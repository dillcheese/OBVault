<u>The Slug  </u>
Cost: 15 SP  
Your power allows you to edit brains through touch. You can brainwash individuals, erase memories, and implant knowledge of languages you know into individuals. You’re able to remove powers as you can choose to edit the brain of an affected individual so that a spoken key word or phrase will permanently take away their connection to their powers, i.e., the individual loses their powers for good. You can also set a spoken key word or phrase that temporarily removes that individual's powers. Though this can be taxing if overused.

Teacher  
Cost: 11 SP  
You have a master/trump power that grants thinker/tinker powers to people you choose, however the stronger the power the greater decrease in faculties in the subject, making them unable to express any information/skills from their abilities. You can also modify existing powers to a limited degree, by using a sort of hypnotic state to unlock it, similar to a second trigger.

Sere  
Cost: 12 SP  
You have the ability to violently draw in moisture from your environment, allowing you to stun or kill your targets. This ability ignores force fields and armor. This limited hydrokinesis, which is conversely not Manton-limited, is effectively targeted dehydration. You can use your power in a long tight cone-shaped "blast" or in a tight field around you. The moisture you extract remains floating around you.

Scrub  
Cost: 13 SP  
Your power constantly generates beach ball-sized spheres of energy in your immediate vicinity that manifest as flashes of white light. Your shard finds a parallel Earth with roughly corresponding architecture and swaps more permanent elements of this architecture in as needed, while shunting any remaining matter caught in these blasts out to that parallel Earth. Thus, your spherical explosions appear to delete matter but typically leave the ground and buildings intact because they are effectively portal cuts that also swap select elements in to avoid tearing up your own footing, as such your power never blasts the ground out from under your feet.  
Your spheres of energy are All-or-Nothing, their shunting/swapping of matter cannot be blocked by any non-perfect defense. Including the Endbringers. You can push your power into overdrive to generate explosions more frequently. As your power is heavily interdimensional, your power is always on, you also have limited control over your power as the placement of your explosions is somewhat random. As such to avoid any friendly fire, you must keep your distance from allies. You also can’t really control where your blasts hit with any degree of accuracy as you only have some ability to dictate their general direction and frequency (i.e., spam a general area). Your power has a relatively short range of no more than around 20 feet.

Scaffold (maybe bohu-esque)  
Cost: 12 SP  
You have the ability to create and alter building layouts, by creating architecture with your power. You can use this ability to slide walls around, create walls where there weren't any, create trapdoors, etc.  
Tōng Líng Tǎ  
Cost: 13 SP  
You can send out terrain altering pulses that shape it to your design. Within your scope is raising new buildings, restructuring existing ones, including the direct control of the features of the building, or razing structures entirely. This allows you to maintain and clean buildings. Though you’re too slow to use in a fast moving battle situation. You can create an entire palace and cancel out seismic events in your area of influence.

Saltykov  
Cost: 8 SP  
You compel others within your range to reverse allegiances, acting out with extreme prejudice against things they valued most, to the best of their abilities. The more they love it, the more they’ll want to destroy or ruin it.

Ravager  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can imbue weapons, objects, and ammunition with the ability to inflict gradually worsening wounds that smoke and sting. All wounds you inflict will bleed, fester and permanently scar if not tended to, with scratches having the potential to worsen into evisceration. You have a clairvoyant awareness of those you wound. You also have enhanced strength, reflexes, and agility.

### S9

[Jack Slash](#bookmark=id.tn4t4bhmk21y)  
[Siberian](#bookmark=id.1lz67gp4hc6a)  
[Crawler](?tab=t.kzwdt7kbxrlo#bookmark=kix.h91hakwrxnik)  
[Bonesaw](?tab=t.kzwdt7kbxrlo#bookmark=kix.qizbgdl3s5kq)/Blasto

Winter  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can create a dampening effect that causes bullets to lose their inertia, heat to seep out of areas, energy attacks to lose their fizzle, and humans to lose their will. You can concentrate your power in a smaller area, halting all motion. Even at its widest and least intense, it reduced ambient temperatures to the point that moisture freezes in the air, creating a telltale mist. People under its effect experienced a mental torpor, feeling their thoughts slow to a crawl. They will stand still as if they died from the cold.

Shatterbird  
Cost: 8 SP  
You have the ability to manipulate silicon through high-frequency sounds, giving you essentially perfect control over all glass, sand, and other siliceous compounds.

Screamer  
Cost: 9 SP  
You have the ability to manipulate sound within roughly a mile's radius. You can use it to amplify your voice, alter it to match others, throw it to speak directly into people's ears, or cancel out sounds you don't want to hear. Your abilities also allow you to hear sounds in any given area. It is almost impossible to cancel you out as you can transmit sound, and by extension words, through multiple mediums. This includes bone, thus earplugs or earmuffs are ineffective. You can modulate the sound to the point that people will hear what you’re saying as if it’s the voice within your head. You can overload everyone in your range with a deafening jarring scream.  
Triumph  
Cost: 4 SP  
Your power is sound manipulation, of which you can control its force, area of effect, and unleash it in bursts. You also sport a mild healing factor, healing quicker than average with minimal scarring. Your sound blasts are capable of punching through concrete.

Psychosoma  
Cost: 6 SP  
You can encase people within semi-real illusions of monsters that are under your control. While encased in this monster form, the victim is completely unconscious for the duration. The physical form of these monsters can range widely; from large wall-crawling spiders to nightmarish tentacle creatures to lizard-like beasts with razor-sharp claws and teeth. ~~However, these illusions are as fragile as glass and the victim will return to normal once the illusion is broken.\\~~

### Power Fusion

Armamentarium  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:Blaster (Deadshot)  
Required:(Blaster/Shaker) Musketeer  
Required: Miss Militia, or Hana  
Required:Full Set  
You attained Armamentarium’s full potential, at least what’s afforded in a \[Cycle\].  
You can bring a stockpile of weaponry, around a thousand (1000) from every stretch of the imagination, collected by the Entities’ previous host species. Ranging from primal armaments (i.e. swords, spears, halberds, shields, scythe, etc.), modern (handguns, SMGs, rifles, snipers, LMGs, rocket, and grenade launchers, etc.) to sci-fi-like weaponry (holo-weaponry, energy weapons, mass-drive weapons, etc.). And that's not all, with defensive armaments such as armor/exoskeletons, too. This contains the advancements and specialties they relied on in all the exotic and alien splendor.  
This stockpile is unilaterally and telekinetically controlled, each weapon a mental instance to handle its mechanisms as well as modifying its attachments and blueprints, even including exotic effects to any part of the payload or chassis, such as kinetic-absorbent slugs or automatic laser rifles with ray-beam modes. When it comes to controlling your weaponry, instead of disappearing once their mags are empty, they automatically refill, and your marksmanship is further honed to its own caliber: do you know what those assassins from Wanted can do with a gun? It’s that with ricocheting as cherry on top… nearing as a homing effect.  
Although your armory is war-ending, there are some limitations: the more complex and dangerous an armament, the more taxing, with less variant weaponry you can conjure, i.e., you can use an array of 1000 .22LR pistols or rifles with no sweat off your brow, yet more than ten thermobaric nuclear energy LMGs? Not if your life counts on it. Oh, and your Shard prevents you from summoning the most devastating of the bunch, for “fairness’” sake, it said.  
*The Sieging Stronghold*  
Required:(Shaker/Master) Tower Defence  
Required:(Tinker) Fortifications and Artillery  
You’ve become a walking fortress and siege engine, as your ability to create and manipulate defense structures and improve upon their foundations is incorporated into Armamentarium.  
Armamentarium improves the constructs’ formidability, with turrets gaining adaptability in the shape of mobility and cutting-edge tinkertech, e.g., mobile missile launchers or AI-assisted ionic rays; barriers are now more responsive to the environment and opposition, e.g., barrier adapt an electrostatic coat to avoid climbing; and minions inherit the skills of those that utilized Armamentarium’s armament as echoes of warriors.  
All of this helps to build siege engines and strongpoints, a stronghold’s polar opposite: turrets become artillery and ordnance, barriers take an offensive use, and minions fire set off suppressive fire to gain ground.  
Your energy pool efficiency is enhanced to make a defense that leaves Rogal Dorn blushing with only half of your energy expenditure, aiding in loosening your inherent limitations on summoning weaponry and strongpoints.  
*WMD*  
Required:Chaotic Tinker  
Your \[Cycle\] restrictions on how catastrophic you can be are lifted. With Chaotic Tinker, once your seed of havoc is born, the most dangerous weaponry and ordnance the Entities ever encountered are free to be summoned: war machines to raze cities, a matter-annihilating cannon, or a grav-gun that fires black holes, anything that of short ruins the ecosystem of a planet is on a charred silver platter.  
Blaster (Deadshot)  
Cost: 1 SP  
You have an intuitive understanding of angles and trajectories, granting you nearly perfect aim. You can line up your shots nearly instantly, even for complex trajectories where the projectile bounces. You are still capable of missing if your aim is thrown off.  
Soldier of the Future  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required: Hana, or Miss Militia  
Required: (Tinker) Revolution, or (Tinker) Reproduction  
You can use Miss Militia's power with any Tinkertech weapon you've touched.  
Miss Militia  
Cost: 4 SP  
You can form weapons from a semi-sentient blue-black blur of energy. These weapons have unlimited ammo and can only be mundane in origin. You also have a perfect memory and don't need to sleep.  
(Blaster/Shaker) Musketeer  
Cost: 15 SP  
Your shard enables you to summon single-use muskets around you, which turn into mist and disappear after use. These muskets are extremely durable, capable of withstanding multiple hits from mid to high-tier brutes before breaking. Additionally, they have virtually zero bullet drop when fired. You can choose how powerful each musket is when summoning it. Once fired, the musket ball can be strong enough to pierce titanium and even cause high-tier brutes to have second thoughts. You can summon as many muskets as you want, but you are only limited to having 200 active muskets around you at a time.  
Your shard also grants you the power of telekinesis when summoning your muskets, along with excellent marksmanship. This telekinesis allows you to manipulate and control the muskets as if they were another limb, knowing their exact positions and where they are aiming at all times. The telekinesis also extends to controlling the musket ball once fired, making it easier for you to hit your targets accurately.  
Although you have perfect control over the muskets when they are close to you, your telekinetic control weakens with distance, reducing both accuracy and control.  
*The American Way*  
Required:Miss Militia  
Your muskets can now be any mundane, modern firearm. They will appear fully loaded. The firearm automatically disappears after it has used up all its ammunition.  
*The 2° Amendment*  
Required:(Tinker) Guns  
You can create musket variants of any gun you have made before. If you have The American Way then you can summon full fledged versions of any gun you have made, although it will be under the same restrictions, making it disappear after it has used up its ammo.  
Full Set  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Armor  
Required:(Tinker) Shields  
Required: (Tinker) Swords, or (Tinker) Guns  
Your newfound specialization possesses the unique ability to create gear that surpasses the sum of its individual components. You have the skill to craft Shields or Armors that not only absorb attacks but can also utilize the absorbed energy to power your Armor, recharge your Shields, or even redirect the energy back through your Guns/Swords. Moreover, your Armor has the capability to enhance your Shields, and your Attacks can extract energy from adversaries, be it blood, electricity, or even esoteric elements like momentum.

Empire of Sound  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Sound Engineer  
Required:(Shaker) The Sound of Silence  
Required: (Shaker/Thinker) Omni-Kinesis, or (Shaker) Natural World  
Your control of the physical, either by conducting an orchestral interplay of matter and energy and/or being smitten by nature’s song, is now dancing to the tune of your anthem.  
Your knack for engineering tinkertech for sound and music, while using your control of vibrations as a medium, went through a breakthrough owing to its newfound handle of cymatics, vibrations giving matter form which, when vibrated, generates energy. Attuning your tinkertech to these frequencies is as easy as a tune-up, taking many forms: a guitar, a microphone, a Sound or DJ deck balancing ease-of-use and intricacy.  
How this works is simple, your music and melodies contain frequencies and vibrations modulating and altering the world at large and/or emulating the world’s experiences tempered by your message/intention and what you intend with a track, the physical world adjusting by “mood” and “vibe” of the song or melody, to see creation come undone.  
Almost anything can be accomplished through this, with imagination and Entity-imposed restrictions being the only limitations.  
(Tinker) Sound/Vibration  
Cost: 5 SP  
Your tinker-tech specialises in the phenomena of acoustics and vibrations, capable of constructing sonar radars able to picture cities, and acoustic cannons with both concussive and disorienting effects. Anything relating to sound and vibrational frequencies can be replicated through this.  
Sound Engineer  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Sound/Vibration  
Not only can you fashion contraptions using sound or vibrational frequencies, but you can also use sounds and vibrations themselves in the form of music. It can range from record production to audio engineering surpassing conventional limitations, such as implanting subtle or overt Master effects within your work.  
(Shaker) The Sound of Silence  
Cost: 25 SP  
Hear that? Perhaps you didn’t. Sound and vibrations are yours to control. Among these abilities, is the power to generate and control shockwaves; you can generate shockwaves strong enough to send large cyborgs flying off their feet, or to destroy objects, to the point that you could easily collapse buildings with them. Alongside this, you can also manipulate or shatter things with acoustic resonance. You are also able to use vibrations for sensory purposes, such as with echolocation. This manipulation of vibrations also allows you to deafen or even remove sound and vibrations from you and your surroundings, rendering yourself and/or the environment silent.  
(Shaker/Thinker) Omni-Kinesis  
Cost: 25 SP  
In a radius of 50 meters around you, with nothing but your will alone you are capable of shaping the physical world. Moving objects, generating and manipulating all forms of energy or matter, or even creating psychic constructs.  
The world is a vast ocean of vibration, matter, and energy to your senses, and all it takes is a thought to send it moving according to your wishes. Complex systems such as biology and technology will require a great deal of practice before you can reliably work them the same way you would matter and energy, with other powers here being far better at doing so and developing faster.

Erebus  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Mover/Stranger) Shadow Diver  
Required:(Master) Shadow Servant  
Required:(Shaker/Mover) Nyx  
Required:Shade  
Required:Chiaroscuro  
The combination of your various darkness powers has elevated you to the illustrious status of being the very manifestation of darkness.  
Your weakness to light is diminished, but not removed entirely, and your range increases by two orders of magnitude, enough to drown some smaller cities in darkness. The power of your shadows is greatly magnified, such that your shadowy constructs may tear through Endbringer flesh like butter, only encountering difficulty with the deepest layers. Your Shade is even further amplified by this, becoming a veritable juggernaut even from the moment of its creation and only getting stronger from there.  
Your Breaker form has shared traits with your Shade, gaining its ability to attack, consume, and mimic shadows and giving the Shade the Breaker Form’s ability to absorb darkness to regenerate. Additionally, absorbing darkness no longer just heals but also increases strength temporarily, such that “consuming” the darkness of a large cavern would be enough to manhandle Endbringers with ease. You can even merge with your Shade, forming a single existence with the combined power of both of you.  
You possess much expertise traveling and manipulating the sea of shadows, being able to lurk within it’s depths indefinitely. Furthermore, you are able to use your shadows as a bridge to banish others into its abyssal darkness, trapping them there and using its darkness to smother the light within them. Furthermore, smothering someone within the shadow realm counts as consuming them, increasing your power and knowledge.  
Lastly, your initial pool for creating shadowy servants has grown in size, enough that you could create a single servant on par with an Endbringer, and continues to grow at a much faster rate when in darkness. Furthermore, the strength of your servants has increased as well, with their baseline starting point already being high-level Brutes. With this you may eventually create an entire army of servants on par with Endbringers.  
(Mover/Stranger) Shadow Diver  
Cost: 12 SP  
Once cloaked in darkness, you may transform into an intangible, fluid-like substance, merging seamlessly within the shadows. Within this form, you swim and dive through the darkness as effortlessly as a shark navigates the open ocean. Movement within this shadowy domain is an alien experience—less like swimming and more akin to floating weightlessly through the void.  
This shadowy expanse—a pocket dimension sustained by your shard—exists as an otherworldly reflection of reality, directly tied to the shadows it originates from. The size and depth of this shadow sea mirror the dimensions of the casting shadow: the larger and darker the umbra, the more expansive and profound the realm becomes.  
Skimming the surface of this stygian sea allows you to observe and eavesdrop on the physical world through the shadow's origin. Beneath this surface, however, the sea reveals its true mysteries—hidden fissures and caverns leading to other shadows across reality, connected to distant pockets of darkness. While submerged, you remain utterly undetectable, eluding powers designed to pierce through concealment.  
Yet, this shadowy sanctuary is not without its limits. Your presence within any single shade is finite, forcing you to constantly move in shallower shadows or risk ejection if you linger too long. While deeper, darker shadows grant extended respite without disruption.  
As you descend into the shadowy abyss. You'll find your perception of reality warping as the fabric of reality begins to twist and distort. Near the surface, the effects are subtle, with only minor disruptions to time and space. But the deeper you venture, the more profound the distortion becomes. Distant locations may take less or more time than reason would logically dictate.  
This dissonance creates a surreal, dreamlike journey through the shadow's unfathomable depths, where the boundaries of reality blur and yield to your passage.  
(Master) Shadow Servant  
Cost: 15 SP  
You possess a master power enabling the creation of shadow minions of any desired shape or size —be it bipeds, quadrupeds, or formless entities resembling slimes— while always retaining the color and form of shadows. You have a pool of power that governs the "birth" and sustenance of these creatures, offering a choice between prioritizing quantity or enhancing their individual quality. You can have up to 15 regular minions, create a super one capable to withstand a normal battle Endbringer most powerful attack, or any combination in between. While your minions cannot wield Trump powers, the only limitation on the number of powers they can possess is determined by your power pool.  
Shade  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:(Master) Detached Shadow  
Your Shadow has evolved into a Shade, gaining a few abilities. First, it can now directly engage and attack other shadows, inflicting physical damage on the person or creature that casts the targeted shadow. This ability effectively allows your Shade to strike at foes from a distance or even in total darkness. Additionally, your Shade can consume other shadows, a process that not only harms the original owner but also transfers their strength and vitality to both you and your Shade, enhancing your physical abilities and extending your Shade's reach and potency.  
Moreover, by consuming a shadow, your Shade gains access to the memories and experiences that took place within that shadow. This means that by devouring the shadow of a person or creature, you can uncover their secrets, learn about their past, or even gain insights into hidden locations or plans. The more shadows your Shade consumes, the stronger and more knowledgeable it becomes, gradually evolving into a powerful entity with its own reservoir of collective memories, drawn from the countless shadows it has devoured.  
As a final ability, your Shade can now cloak itself in the shadows it consumes, allowing it to adopt the appearance, size, or even the behavior of the shadows it has eaten. This makes it an excellent tool for deception, infiltration, or laying traps, as your Shade can disguise itself as a seemingly harmless or mundane entity before striking.  
(Master) Detached Shadow  
Cost: 9 SP  
You can detach your shadow, allowing it to move around freely and act as it wishes. It can freely travel through or stay within other shadows, however its movements will be limited when in the light. You can also manifest your shadow, giving it an actual 3 dimensional form instead of its original 2 dimensional form. The shadow can morph itself, however limited only to what types of shadows you can make via shadow puppets. Your shadow will be stronger the bigger it naturally would be, and the more shadows there are in the area. When detached you will have no shadow.  
*Shadow Lands*  
Required:(Master) Shadow Servant  
Your pool increases slowly, the rate increasing by staying in darker places. This allows you to create more shadow minions. All your shadow minions also gain the ability to both stay within your shadow and travel in a 2 dimensional form.  
(Shaker/Mover) Nyx  
Cost: 20 SP  
You now have the ability to manipulate darkness and shadows with precision and control. Able to create, shape, and harness them for various purposes. While Darkness is mostly used to cloud everything into complete obscurity, it can also be harnessed as both the absence of light and a tangible substance. With it, you possess the capacity to manipulate entities existing within darkness, establish and dissolve shields and areas of absolute darkness, construct tools and weaponry sharp enough to rend through steel like a hot knife through butter, make shadowy servants that are able to go toe to toe with high-level brutes, teleport vast distances by traversing through shadows, your versatility with this power is bound only by the extent of your imagination. Your range extends within a radius of 200 meters around you. You also get unlimited multitasking with this.  
It is worth noting that powers based on light are particularly potent against you. However, your ability to withstand and resist these light-based abilities increases in darker environments, allowing you to maintain a stronger defense against them.  
Chiaroscuro  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required: (Shaker/Mover) Nyx, or (Shaker/Mover) Eos  
The essence of your chosen power has fully infused into your very being, granting you the ability to transform into a pure Breaker state in which you consist entirely of your “element”, whether light or dark.  
In this form, you can manipulate your size, shape and overall consistency at will, allowing you to shift seamlessly from being as solid as steel to as fluid as running water. You can regenerate in this form by drawing upon your respective “element” from your surrounding environment as fuel. Additionally, you are self-sustaining in this Breaker state, no longer requiring food, water, air, or sleep, and can remain in this form indefinitely.  
However, in this Breaker state, you are particularly vulnerable to powers and abilities tied to your opposite “element”. Despite this weakness, environments containing significant amounts of your chosen “element” will help you withstand and resist these attacks.  
If you possess both (Shaker/Mover) Nyx and (Shaker/Mover) Eos, this vulnerability to extremes of light and dark is completely removed and you can blend both light and dark simultaneously into your Breaker state, producing a harmonious duality that greatly enhances your versatility and power.

Kinetics & Dynamics  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:Assault  
Required:Ballistic  
Required:Krieg  
Your powers centred around kinetic energy have unified together, granting you near-complete control over all kinetic-related energies and forces within your vicinity.  
Your control over kinetic energy extends to a 200-metre radius of yourself. Within this range, you are capable of seamlessly absorbing, imbuing, redirecting and transferring nearly all kinetic forces, whether they're related to motion, acceleration, impact, friction or otherwise. Furthermore, your capacity to store kinetic energy has become virtually limitless, allowing you to even absorb physical attacks from an Endbringer.  
Complementing this control is a secondary ability that provides an intuitive awareness of all kinetic energy transfers and movements within your sphere of influence. This understanding is detailed and immediate, enabling you to instinctively react and alter the energy dynamics around you if under threat.  
Thanks to this awareness, your application of this power is also capable of being highly elaborate. For example, you could potentially emulate telekinesis via the remote application and manipulation of objects' kinetic energies. However, such fine manipulation requires intense concentration with your multitasking capacity also limiting how much you can manipulate at any given time.

Lord of Frenzied Flame  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Shaker) Frenzied Flame  
Required:(Master/Trump) Open Eyes  
Required:(Shaker) Bedlam  
Required: Ruler of the Primordial Flames, or (Breaker/Shaker) Hellfire  
Your flames crackle and flare a mad glint, something hungry and tired, so tired of the world, of its complexities, the misery and hardship that comes with it. This flame will burn it all, so that all be one, once again.  
Your fire shows an encroaching and/or corruptive trait, any living thing scorched or burned will be corrupted or driven to a frenzy by your flames, slowly “burning” their body and mind, in turn, twisting and warping them to chaotic messes, or their minds are left charred by the Flame’s leaving them stark raving mad. The mere flame’s heat is enough to set a man into delirium. This applies to anything, as well, deteriorating everything your fire burns, as if losing its form and essence–or “order”, to say the least, e.g. a chair will lose the form of “chair” in the middle of burning, the flames seemingly melting the chair’s “order”.  
Whether your fire has the heat of a bonfire or a supernova, your control over your flames spreads through your flames of chaos, a sickly yellow in intensity, blazing more as writhing worms eagerly search for their next meal.

Ruler of the Primordial Flames adds an element of fine control, completely mastering your flame’s havoc, your ashes and cinders receiving the searing madness of your flames, as you can radiate and infect people with your madness, gift the flame’s frenzy for a short time, and your core taking the appearance of a corona with a wild ebb and flows of flames, resembling a frantic fiery iris.  
Hellfire completely exacerbates your Frenzied Flame’s destructive potential, wreaking havoc as far as the eye can see, easily and rapidly corrupting and destroying anything in your path in an instant; one moment, there was a park, a Protectorate Team doing PR around the southwest, you sweep an area with your flames; there’s no park, whatever you could call the silhouettes, charred shapes once bodies, and anything else that melted away in chaos, the rest faded away in ashes. The entire Central Park.  
If you have any other flame based powers, they can be expressed through this one.

To Fear It Is To Give It Power  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Changer) Daymare  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Fear  
You now have the ability to passively sense fear, permanently growing in strength and powers from absorbing specific fears you encounter. For example, by absorbing someone’s fear of spiders, you can gain the ability to summon or control them. This also gives you a new form, its appearance based on what types of fears you absorb the most of. When you are in this form it boosts all your fear based powers. The more fear you absorb, the greater your power becomes, amplifying your abilities as the intensity of fear increases. If you have any other powers, they will also be able to grow through fear you absorb, slowly being altered and taking traits of whatever fear you use to feed them.

The Parahuman Anathema  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:Animos  
Required:Hatchetface  
Required:(Shaker/Trump) Power Slowdown  
Required:(Trump/Stranger) Power Confusion  
Required:(Trump) Exonerate  
You are the epitome of Trump Nulls: An All-or-Nothing Trump Null. Your power-nullifying powers have integrated to create an incredibly effective override for parahumans and parahuman effects. Possessing an enclosing and invisible oval-shaped ‘Null-field’ over a 2m radius from you, while constantly active at first to even loss of consciousness or sleep, it can be consciously turned on/off.

This ‘Null-field’ completely negates a Parahuman’s connection with their Shard, including power constructs or effects such as Miss Militia’s weapons, Gallant’s emotion sense and blasts, Oni Lee’s teleportation duplication, and Clockblocker’s All-or-Nothing Striker power, Tinkertech in general (leaving it inert or obsolete), among a myriad of others. This extends to normal objects under a power effect, namely, a baseball launched by a Brute or Shaker, including Containment Foam for being mass-produced by parahuman hands, to name a few. Some objects, such as Bastard Son’s or Dauntless’ weapons/objects are restored to normal, lacking any influence from said capes. It likewise encompasses Thinker and Master classifications, preventing Shards from reaching and gaining a drop of info or hold over you, practically giving ad-hoc Mental Barrier and Blank at middling levels.  
Evidently, once leaving your null field Parahumans recover their powers and reestablish their Shard Connection.  
This has several features inherited from this power’s components:  
Animos and Hatchetface give a Trump/Brute power proportional to the amount of Parahumans within a radius of 200m, sacrificing Animos’ Changer form to focus more on its power-canceling traits; this takes on an offensive form of extending your Null-field by a snap’s moment to said radius, completely shutting down capes left and right and leaves them vulnerable while earning an increase on physical abilities geared on disabling parahumans and deception. This extension is theoretically infinite provided there are enough capes in your proximity for your Null-field, only limited by happenstance and usual Shard restrictions, speedily expending its full tank once your Null-field’s range assumingly reaches worldwide.  
Power Slowdown and Confusion can selectively be applied to Parahumans delaying and hampering their powers, worsening their power expression causing them to experience out-of-control disruptions, dilution, and aftereffects leaving their powers in disarray even after leaving your Null-field if you want.  
Exonerate, being the biggest component for this, has a Trump Card, strangely enough… and it’s that its effect can be permanent at your leisure, say, a chair you’re sitting on turns into an All-or-Nothing extension of your power, or a person once you touch can be impervious to any parahuman effect or construct.  
All this burdens you with the mantle of the Parahuman Bane: capes have an underlying unease around you, you vaguely sense where a Parahuman is and can be and easily locate them at the drop of a hat in sight, even a faint urge to prod and probe them on their powers.  
You’re Anathema, a Parahuman’s polar opposite. The \[Cycle’s\] Equalizer.

Gaol  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Imprisonment  
Required:(Tinker/Thinker) Control  
Required:(Tinker/Thinker) Suppress, Conjecture, Predict  
You become the architect of worlds marked by Tyranny or Decimation.  
Having the full capacity to create tinker or non-tinker projects spanning nations able to conquer, dominate, and subjugate anything on your path, putting together systems or societies capable of exploiting resources and manpower to uphold and preserve your controlling industrial complex the same time supplying materials and capital to further expand your reach. Once conquered, you assemble any type of government or institution solely focused on authority, power, discipline, and the consequences thereof.  
Both your Prison and Control specialties meld to lay the foundation of megastructures and conventions in compliance’s favor being either soft or hard in approach. You might model it in the style of They Live, any Sci-fi punk story, Orwell or Huxley alike, no matter how you administer it, all are forms of coercion.  
SCP works for circumstances or dissents hard to contain or keep in check, bringing more cabbalistic methods of administration and repression, ending up in subversion through research and understanding.  
All of this organizes environments for the sole goal of inspiring conflict from this oppression and others’ frustration at the danger and lack of agency, generating a higher rate of parahumans; a facilitator of the \[Cycle\], demanding and forcing a species under duress of an oppressing position to undergo crisis points, further progressing the \[Cycle’s\] goals of stress-testing powers on different worlds to an abundance of stressful experiences or activities.  
*False Flag*  
Required:Chaotic Tinker  
Chaos (Chaotic Tinker) and Order (Gaol). Two diametrically opposed concepts in the eyes of humanity, ever realizing there’s never one without the other. Chaos is required to create and transform, to fill empty space, and to keep things running and spinning. Order is needed to organize, and make sense of this, giving a purpose, a reason to exist behind their spontaneity, all for a structure that is suitably labeled as chaotic to those who see its boggling complexity. What is chaos, if not incomprehensible order?  
Your expertise on both Chaos and Order begets Dominion on an unimaginable scale: creating circumstances that engender conflict, disasters, and catastrophes enhances your tinkertech’s scope and reach to Order, elaborating ways to stamp out opposition and possible ways for either containment and resolution, further establishing your Dominion; creating structures of oppression and subjugation boost your tinkertech’s scope and reach to Chaos, fashioning all manner of viciously absurd and wild destructive projects, which gives “hope” to your subjects.  
All this is shaped to create a greater system of coercion: A False Flag. Creating Chaos as a pretense to enforce Control, always under other names, other culprits, and many scapegoats, granting the full enhancement on these conditions. Creating Order as the devious gift of false hope all to take it back, cobbling up identities and stories, devising wars against ghost nations, discharging projects and creations of pure unadulterated Chaos made by the so-called freedom-fighters or insurgents, your subjects find no choice but to see you as their best they have, your full improvement likewise granted on said settings. A clasp in the vicious cycle of Chaos and Order.  
*MK Ultra*  
Required:Cognoscenti  
Your full control over your nationwide machine of tyranny requires advocacy, an institution geared to “guide” and “prepare” the populace’s hearts and minds, a way to win them over, and a path to keep it that way. Good thing you possess tinkertech’s full breadth of cognition and information. Cognoscenti supports Gaol around several methods: controlling information to oversee your populace’s perception of the world, disseminating mass media to perpetuate accepted thought processes and ideas, elaborating bureaucracy and methodology geared to shape others into perfect workers through subtle mental conditioning, etc. This assures the (imposed) loyalty within anyone within your purview once the memetic and cognitive control systems are arranged.

Unlimited POWAAAAHHHH\!  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:(Trump) Ramp  
Required:Real Pumped  
You now possess the ability to amplify your strength and powers up to 50 times their normal levels, both physically and in terms of any active or passive abilities. This ramp-up requires about 5 minutes to reach full strength. To activate this boost, you must either be actively using your power or engaged in combat.  
If you activate this boost by using your power outside of a fight, only active abilities will be enhanced; passive powers won’t receive the boost. In this mode, you must maintain continuous use of the power, as any break longer than 5 seconds will reset the boost.  
However, if you engage in combat, both active and passive abilities will continue to ramp up for as long as you remain in the fight, steadily increasing until you reach the full 50-fold enhancement. The boost ends only when combat is fully over, allowing you to unleash your maximum potential throughout the encounter.  
*Lung Wannabe*  
Required:(Trump) Active Combat  
In combat, your powers have no upper limit on how high they can grow. The rate of your power amplification accelerates in response to the strength, numbers, and intensity of your opponents. The stronger or more numerous your foes, the faster you ramp up, allowing you to adapt quickly and push your abilities beyond prior limits. Your base level will never go below 50 times in 5 minutes.

Universal Suspension  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:(Shaker/Blaster) Stilling  
Required:(Breaker/Shaker) Reality Sculptor  
Everything before you is nothing more than mere information. Energy. Matter. Force. Life. All is information.  
Within a radius of up to 1km, you may extend a field in which everything in the universe is transferred into a suspended state of pure information. In this information state, all external actors cease to exist. Time stops flowing and physics stops functioning altogether. You are immune to this suspension.  
Others caught within your range while active are unable to move or perceive what is happening. As others are unable to update the information suspended in your field, any change you impose becomes permanent.

Movement for you is achieved by updating the information that describes your position; therefore you can move anywhere within your suspended region with no concept of speed. Every action you desire to take is similarly an update to the information previously describing your previous action(s).  
Durability, regeneration, and the like are meaningless before you as you can overwrite the information of an obstacle by your desired action.  
Esoteric effects enacted by others may have momentary effects on you upon initial contact, but without a continuous stream of information to continue their effects, they die out in a mere moment. Some esoteric and nonnative phenomena may fail to be suspended without further exposure.  
You have a Thinker ability that allows you to perceive and process the entirety of the information within your field without any negative effects.  
*Null Arc*  
Required:(Blaster/Striker) Sting  
Projectiles imbued with Sting now suspend all laws of physics upon impact. The impact and other effects of these projectiles will propagate across the target, even if they exist in multiple dimensions. The propagation only extends to the limits of the information describing the target.  
*\[Transfer Protocol\]*  
Required:(Mover/Thinker) Ideal Transit  
The unbounded teleportation ability of yours now extends to your suspension field. Your field no longer needs to be centered on your position. If your suspension field is already active when you warp it, any information contained in it may be warped with it. Objects warped this way will overwrite anything they share a position with at their destination.  
*Harmonic Divergence*  
Required:(Breaker/Trump) Ignis Fatuus  
Within your suspension field, you can now choose for only select laws of physics to be suspended while all others continue to work (emergently less effectively). You may choose to only overwrite specific aspects of information contained in your field while the rest reacts and functions normally in response to your actions.  
Because you control the information within your field, you may also flicker the contents of your field as per the base functionality of Ignis Fatuus.  
*\[Overflow\]*  
Required:(Striker/Master) Jack Slash  
Required:(Thinker/Trump) \[Query\] \[Response\]  
You no longer have to activate your Universal Suspension to gather data. You can passively access a read-only version of your Universal Suspension field in order to perceive and be aware of the same information. You are also able to force large amounts of information on other people in range. Most minds aren't equipped to handle that much information that quickly.  
*\[Comprehension\]*  
Required: (Trump) Art of Symbolism , or (Thinker/Trump) Sylar  
Not all information exists within a vacuum. It often is tied to context and emerging circumstances. You can now perceive and understand this emergent or "soft" information that is within range. You can observe thoughts and memories of individuals, correlate states of particles and their observable properties, etc.  
*Digital Entourage*  
Required:(Thinker) Simulacrum Advisor  
Required: (Trump) Art of Symbolism , or (Thinker/Trump) Sylar  
Instead of mere simulations, you can create full digital clones of those within your range. These clones are capable of existing outside of your mind and within a range of 10km of you. They are functionally independent of your influence, but will return to your mind if they drift out of range. These clones can communicate with you instantaneously regardless of their position. As the clones are based on digital information, they cannot physically manipulate their surroundings. Updating or making new clones requires an activation of your Universal Suspension to gather adequate data.

Proprietor of Properties  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Chevalier  
Required:(Striker) Property Catalogue  
Property Catalogue and Chevalier have coalesced together to grant you an extraordinary understanding and power over the properties of things... and so the world itself.  
You intuitively understand the properties of everything within your line of sight or touch, these appearing to you as complex abstract lines, shapes and symbols. There are no limits on the transfer and combination of properties such as the number of things you can potentially fuse together.  
You can freely adjust the properties of objects, surfaces and people you have previously touched at any distance as if you were touching them directly. For example, you could make a baseball you threw gain the density of lead mid-flight while retaining its inertia. You can have properties only apply to select areas, blend an item's appearance with another or tune a property to a midpoint in between those available with ease.  
When fusing things, only your initial concentration and stamina drain are required, meaning that you can permanently fuse items so long as it is originally possible. Furthermore, the limit on items needing to be similar has lessened, allowing you to fuse objects with greater differences in properties between them. However, if the differences are too great, it still isn't possible to merge them; you couldn't fuse a matchstick with a truck, for instance, although a steel construction beam would work.  
*Conceptual Collector*  
Required:Conceptual Catalogue  
Required:The Gibborim Knight  
Your ability to manipulate properties has reached a new level, expanding beyond the physical to include the abstract and conceptual.  
These properties can range from beauty, fragility and passion to fundamental concepts like life and death. You can even harness and manipulate the complex properties of parahumans and their powers' effects, like Alexandria’s durability, via your touch.  
Your multidimensional nature allows you to alter your own conceptual properties with the same ease as that of others. This includes modifying, bestowing or fusing yourself with abstract properties, objects and even other people. For instance, you could take the conceptual ‘authority’ of a nation’s leader, the 'fluidity' of water or the ‘joy’ of a laughing child.  
Despite your breadth, there are still limits on the level of concepts that you can affect due to shard limitations. For example, high-level and extremely abstract concepts such as Existence, Infinity or Causality would not be workable although possessing Shardless or Esoteric Knowledge would allow you to unlock these concepts in time.

Sangria  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Jabberwocky  
Required:(Trump) Queen of Escalation  
Required:(Brute/Trump) Anu  
As you evolve, when you gain a power you instead gain three unique powers, each capable of solving the source of your problems in different ways. As you use your powers or enter a conflict, your powers experience a permanent growth in them the longer you need to use them the faster this gets. This accelerates your growth speed until the next conflict, only resetting if you go a week without fighting. Your specialties no longer exist because your base form is as strong as all your specialized forms combined and can perform all their functions. As you adapt, all your unused powers and adaptations grow as quickly as the abilities being used, and all your powers learn from your conflicts.  
You can gain powers from situations that don’t necessarily endanger you or involve combat. You can acquire powers and adaptations that help you in other areas, such as becoming smarter to outmaneuver Thinkers or simulating the future to win a board game. The higher the stakes, the faster you adapt to the problem. The more impossible a situation seems, the better and more focused your powers can become. When you are not in combat or actively using your powers, you passively refine the adaptations you gain to improve and combine them. This strengthens them as they merge into a single power capable of multiple functions. As they combine and work together, they can fuse in ways that give rise to something unique or unexpected. With enough combinations, you may even find the \[ANSWER\].  
[(Brute/Trump) Anu](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.f5kvx9grrtrj)

The Joy of Creation  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Toyman  
Required:(Tinker) Robots  
Required: (Tinker) Bio-Mimicry, or (Tinker) Living Machine  
Your robotics expertise and knack for lethal games and entertainment form a deceptively deadly combination: Killer Animatronics.  
Still, these animatronics can be designed to mask this nature, including features, chassis, and modules geared solely to captivate the hearts of kids and grownups alike, concealing their insidious purpose. Even this whimsical front as a medium for their true purpose, i.e., an animatronic that dances, sings, or dispenses ice cream, will utilize those features to harmful effects.  
Being animatronics, your toys specialty takes up the workload of their colorful and charming exoskeleton designs and how harmless they look to the common folk, its design principles following the phrase “wolf in sheep’s clothing”, up to designing doodads and gizmos to increase their “friendliness”, a cupcake, a microphone, or a guitar, to name a few. Your focus on robotics additionally undertakes the animatronics’ foundations, building their endoskeleton, constructing their body, striving to harmonize your robotics engineering with your toylike modeling, and finally integrating and engineering their attractions, carefully toeing the line between suspicion and plausibility.  
But, most of all, the quality setting them aside from the common animatronics… is they’re alive and breathing, breathed into life, a gift they’re eagerly thankful for their Creator. Whether from emulating biological features from living beings using their endoskeleton or using organic material as resources for their endoskeleton, to create intricate machinery indistinguishable from any mechanical gears and bolts, your animatronics pass off as feeling and thinking beings under their nature as “life-like”, to be programmed with elaborate AI almost comparable to Dragon, although, if you wish to leave it at that they’ll simply develop self-awareness with enough time, starting as animalistic in mentality.  
All in all, a normal animatronic of your Creation competes with mid-tier capes, around Brute/Mover 5 in capability, with Changer/Tinker 2-4 based on their engineering complexity and viciousness.  
The level of control you hold on your animatronics counts on their programming, even so, the thought of rebelling against you will not cross their minds.

Mechanical Deus  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:Ogun  
Required:(Tinker/Master) Machine World  
You now possess full conscious control over Ogun, enabling you to dictate exactly what is made as long as you have rudimentary understanding of what you are making. Moreover, any constructs or devices created through Ogun are now permanent, persisting indefinitely unless altered by your will. Using Ogun’s nodes, you can extend (Tinker/Master) Machine World's control, extending your range, allowing you to command and manipulate all connected systems. Additionally, if you relinquish direct control over Ogun’s technology creation, the technology and blueprints created by Ogun are automatically uploaded to your knowledge base, allowing you to replicate and refine them at will.

Resilience  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Trump) Resistance Increase  
Required: (Breaker) Immune Response, Crawler, or (Changer/Brute) Cells At Work  
You have a baseline resistance to everything starting at 50%, but the more you come across a certain threat, the higher your resistance becomes, up to 95%. For example, the more you get burned, the better your resistance to burns becomes. However, the process takes a while, and the higher your resistance, the harder it is to improve it. Certain esoteric principles may be considered completely different things. For example, 95% adaptation to Sting doesn’t grant 95% adaptation to every All-or-Nothing.  
After a certain period of not being harmed, you are cleared of any lingering effects from poison to Master powers. This does not physically heal you, though, so a broken arm will remain. The speed at which effects are cleared is based on the percentage of resistance you have built up to it, with maximum resistance-clearing effects in an hour and minimum resistance-clearing effects in a week.  
*Vaccine*  
Required:(Breaker) Immune Response  
You are fully immune to all kinds of pathogens and poisons, including those engineered by Tinkers. Even the most potent Tinker-designed corrosives and power dampeners are reduced to causing at most a minor rash or slight dizziness. Additionally, you are completely immune to normal forms of poison, heat, cold, electricity, and acids, ensuring that these elements pose no threat to you. While not immune, you are resistant to esoteric forms of energy. While you can withstand the heat from the surface of the sun, other elements such as the lack of oxygen may kill you. These defenses are applied after your resistance is applied.  
*Masochism*  
Required:Crawler  
Your maximum resistance can increase past 100%, the higher the resistance the harder it will be to raise. The more dangerous the situation, the faster you can raise resistance. When your resistance exceeds 100%, instead of being harmed, you will be healed by the excess amount. For example, at 110% resistance, you will be healed by 10% of the damage that would have been inflicted. For powers like Thinker or Master, it does not reflect but instead feeds junk information to a Thinker or breaks a Master's hold on other people.

The Heartbroken  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:Aroa Vasil  
Required:Chastity Vasil  
Required:Florence Vasil  
Required:Guillaume Vasil  
Required:Juliette Vasil  
Required:Nicholas Vasil  
Required:Roman Vasil  
Required:Samuel Vasil  
Required:Heartbreaker  
Required: Jean-Paul Vasil, or Regent  
Required: Cherish, or Cherie Vasil  
You are the Human Master. Any mind within dozens of kilometers is under your control, easily accessible at your command. With a simple thought, you can explore their memories, sense through their senses, see/hear their emotions and change their emotions, bending their wants, fears, and motivations to your will. You can stop them from moving, or turn them into puppets, making them act exactly as you desire.  
Your power goes beyond just thoughts—you control the brain and nervous system itself. You have infinite multitaskings thus allowing you to control countless minds at once, guiding them like pieces in a complex puzzle. You can strengthen or weaken their neural connections, rewrite memories, create or break emotional bonds, and control how they feel pain or pleasure. You could completely control people’s senses by interfering with their nervous system’s signals, telling them that they are seeing or feeling something that isn’t actually happening. You don’t need to lift a finger to break someone’s will or make something they once hated seem irresistible.  
Most terrifying of all, you can completely change how others experience the world. You can make them enjoy what they once despised or change how they react to things they used to love or fear. You can force joy in moments of agony, or create deep fears in even the bravest people. Every thought, feeling, and reaction can be shaped, erased, or replaced by your will alone.  
This control also works on yourself. You can command your own brain and body, pushing yourself far beyond normal limits. Your muscles can strike with superhuman force, ignoring any damage they might take. You can block out pain, heal faster, or even speed up your sense of time to react quicker than any human could. If you ever even feel the need, you could even alter your own personality or create a second mind in your head at will.

Moult  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Changer/Trump) Metamorphosis  
Required:The Flower of the Hecatomb  
Every time you are injured and a newer, better version of you is spawned, this version would have undergone, at minimum, over 3 hours in the cocoon the moment it was created, boosting its powers and capabilities at the cost of loosing it human appearance more and more. The worst the injury, the more they would have transformed and the greater their power becomes.  
*Planarian*  
Required:(Breaker) Rebirth  
You no longer need charges to revive yourself, automatically creating a stronger version of yourself to be revived in everytime you take too much damage at once. The charges are turned into an energy that slowly builds in time. The energy is consumed every time a new version is made. You can choose how much energy is consumed. The more energy consumed once your new version is created, the stronger it is. If you have either the Revive or Immortal upgrade, then the rate you gain energy is greatly accelerated and/or the increase in strength from the energy consumed is greater.  
*The Flower of the Hecatomb*  
Cost: 6 SP  
You’re a Brute, capable of taking immense damage. When you become damaged, a new version of yourself will rip out of your damaged body. This new version is larger and stronger than your normal form. You have potential to grow strong enough to take on or parry a direct attack from a Titan.

Death Parade  
Cost: 25 SP  
Required:(Trump/Master) Butcher  
Required:(Trump) Faerie Queen  
Your shades from Faerie Queen and your headmates from Butcher are now one and the same. This means that you can use the powers of those you have claimed and that you no longer have a limit to how many shades you can summon. Your shades no longer look like caricatures and instead look exactly like their living selfs.  
Your shades can now go as far away from you as you want and your range to claim the powers of Parahumans who died encompasses the entire planet. Now instead of just reincarnating into whoever killed you or last attacked you, you can reincarnate into the closet being with a power or the potential to have one, with the second scenario resulting in you acquiring whatever power they will have.  
Instead of putting to sleep headmates you do not wish to be awake like a serial killer you can instead drain their will. Doing so makes them silent and do nothing, the only moments they will be proactive and do something is when you give orders.  
The powers you acquire through reincarnation no longer become weaker after you abandon the incarnation they come from, instead retaining their full strength. You can channel your Death Touch through your powers, your shades and the powers of your shades.  
[(Trump) Faerie Queen](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.x9phyov4rvqd)

Master of the Hidden Veil  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:(Mover/Thinker) I am the Shadow  
Required:(Stranger) Hidden Cover  
The realm of the hidden and the unseen is now yours to command, allowing you to move, transfer and conceal with remarkable skill and secrecy.  
Instead of just teleporting yourself, you can freely and remotely teleport inanimate objects you're aware of from across the world as long as both the object and the location it's being teleported to are unobserved.  
In addition to this direct teleportation, you may also transport yourself and objects by entering and emerging from behind any suitable cover, akin to a portal. The cover's dimensions must be large enough to allow for it to make reasonable sense and the direct area of the disappearance/emergence must remain unobserved to work. You could crawl out from a large pizza box or draw a sword from your sleeve, but larger objects, like a car, would need to emerge from behind a tree, for instance.  
You can now also extend your ability to "hide" behind things to inanimate objects via touch. This means you can freely conceal items as long as their dimensions make reasonable sense in relation to the cover used to hide behind. For example, you could hide a spear in your pocket or conceal a bicycle behind a lamp post. As they're hidden in this state, you can transport these objects to any other unobserved location at will.  
Finally, your apprehension of the unseen has expanded, granting you complete, real-time awareness and comprehension of everywhere and anything that is unobserved across the planet, in a manner akin to Clairvoyant. This awareness is limited to the dimension you're in, however, and blindspots still apply. Indirect observation such as Thinker powers as well as your own observation don't count for the purposes of this power.  
*Dimension of Hidden Things*  
Required:(Shaker/Blaster) Bag of Holding  
Master of the Hidden Veil has seamlessly integrated with (Shaker/Blaster) Bag of Holding, giving you the power to produce hidden portals to your pocket dimension behind any suitable cover.  
So long as the covers' dimensions make reasonable sense for the objects to pass through and the portal itself is directly unobserved, you can produce as many of these types of portals as your multitasking allows. You can fire something out of these unseen portals at up to 60 miles per hour.  
Additionally, you can choose to transfer any objects concealed via your power into your pocket dimension whenever you wish and have perfect telepathic awareness of everything that you have hidden.

Supercomputer Network  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Shaker/Trump) Genius Friends  
Required:(Thinker/Trump) Networking  
Your ability to interlink minds and elevate the intellect of those within your range has fused and evolved. No longer confined by physical proximity, those who are part of your network now benefit from the increased mental capacity regardless of distance.  
As more people join, their combined intellects build upon each other, leading to increasingly complex and sophisticated thoughts. This isn’t just a simple enhancement—it’s a deep, synergistic fusion of minds where each individual’s contributions elevate the collective intelligence.  
Together, these aspects create a collective consciousness that functions as a singular, unified entity under your command. The network’s overall intelligence grows exponentially as more minds are added, reaching levels far beyond ordinary comprehension. In this state, you and those connected to you have transcended normal cognitive limits, operating on a plane of intelligence and coordination that renders conventional strategies against you obsolete.

The Chaos Engine  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:Magnhild  
Required:Araboth  
Required:Cornerstone  
A revolutionary power has been born within you. The power of Keystone has fused with Araboth, creating The Chaos Engine. This power is dedicated to the manifestation and growth of power in all its forms. Araboth’s charges and Magnhild’s charging ability have been unified into a constantly charging pool that is used to constantly enhance yourself, your network, and fuel your new abilities. These abilities are \[Creation\], \[Evolution\], and \[Fusion\].

\[Creation\] is an upgraded version of Araboth's ability to create new powers and enchantments. Now, powers will not only be made for you, but for all members of Keystone’s network. Members of the network can get tailor-made powers and power configurations suited for their individual strengths, skills, and weaknesses. All new enchantments and powers are recorded into a database from which they can either be used by you, anyone in your network, or manifested as an item. Magnhild’s specific form of item creation also interacts with the rarity system, allowing you to instantly create items at any rarity if you invest enough energy from your pool. Additionally, due to Araboth’s ability to put charges into your own body, you can also enchant people unconnected to the network, giving them the power. Powers and enchantments stored in the database will initially be at the strength of a low T1.  
\[Evolution\] is the process from which the powers and enchantments can grow from a low T1 to a High T3 and above. This growth is fueled by the pool to cause it to grow in as many directions as possible. To help facilitate this growth, powers will sometimes be downgraded to as low as T0 so that they can be regrown into a different direction, allowing for extreme variation with even one initial power. All states of the power are recorded into the database and can be manifested using your available slots, those of your network, or of any item you create. Additionally, \[Evolution\] also cause constant growth in your personal rarity, causing you to complete a full cycle in approximately a month. This can be sped up or slowed down based on much energy from the pool you actively use. You may also increase the rarity of all members of your network at your discretion. \[Evolution\]’s interaction with the network does not stop there. It will also be analyzing their power usage to find interactions between powers depending on their synergy and compatibility. This data will be used to constantly polish their powers in terms of efficiency, use, and configurations (like limitations and Manton Effect).  
\[Fusion\] is quite simply, the fusion of two different powers or enchantments into one. \[Fusion\] can also be used to divide powers into component powers as weak as T0. This is done to combine different aspects of different powers together without having to fuse them completely. Used in conjunction with \[Evolution\], a single power can be expanded upon to create an entire library of powers, with \[Creation\] expanding upon that even further. Manifested items can also be subject to \[Fusion\] allowing you to combine them into higher rarity items or divide them into lower rarity items. \[Fusion\] also benefits the network by allowing powers used by different members to interact with each other in specific and targeted ways or preventing interference between them.

Artisan  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Style  
Required:(Tinker/Thinker) Garment  
Your power has evolved far beyond a mere understanding of fashion and design, now granting you a mastery over the entire spectrum of artistic and functional creations. You possess an intuitive command of both the artistic and scientific aspects of design, allowing you to seamlessly merge creativity with cutting-edge technology across a wide range of mediums.  
Not only can you design clothing that reflects and amplifies emotions and personality, but you can also apply your expertise to the creation of art, furniture, carpets, and other decor. Whether it's crafting textiles with unique properties, designing furniture that is both aesthetically stunning and ergonomically perfect, or creating art that resonates on an emotional and psychological level, your abilities span across all dimensions of artistic expression.  
Your understanding of materials goes down to the molecular level, enabling you to craft items with advanced functionalities—like self-cleaning fabrics, temperature-regulating furniture, or adaptive art that changes based on the environment or the viewer's mood. Every creation you make is not only visually compelling but also optimized for durability, comfort, and specific needs, blending form and function in perfect harmony.  
Moreover, your ability to read and understand the emotions and intentions behind others’ design choices has deepened. You can detect the subtle interplay of materials, craftsmanship, and artistic intent that convey hidden messages, allowing you to perceive not just surface emotions but also the deeper intentions, status, and psychological state of the creator or owner. You are at the forefront of innovation in art, design, and decor, capable of transforming any space or object into a masterpiece that resonates with those who encounter it.

"Oh, Just One More Thing..."  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Conspiracy Nut  
Required:Tattletale  
Having the power that intuits connections, but never tells you the ‘how’, and the power that can infer/deduce said ‘how’, but doesn’t know what to truly focus on, and deliberately choosing not to have them work together would be the ultimate act of stupidity. Because of this, these two powers now work together to become a mystery-solving engine, able to help you figure out the connections Conspiracy Nut gives, or give you a good lead to get more information to solve it.

Provided you feed them information about the subjects of the connections you make, this fusion will fill in the blanks with what they can infer. This is not a “Path to Solving Mysteries”, but rather an ability that gives you a solid lead that gets you closer to solving that mystery, if it's unable to solve it then and there, that is. Along with this, any information/connections that aren’t necessary to know about (either for solving the mystery, or if the information is beneficial for you to know) will be filtered out when focusing your powers on figuring out the connections proposed by you or Conspiracy Nut, thus giving you more time to use your powers before a Thinker headache comes around. With these two powers working in tandem, a ‘power couple’ of powers that detectives all over the world would kill for, to call you the parahuman version of Lieutenant Columbo or Sherlock Holmes wouldn’t be far off from the truth.  
You can still use these powers on their own, but they work best when used together. This fusion synergizes well with other Thinker powers, or powers that excel in gathering information. If able, the boon of ‘any unnecessary information being filtered out’ will also apply to any of these powers when following the condition mentioned before.  
[Tattletale](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.k93j81l4dnwv)

Boosted Gear  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Trump/Brute) Twice Critical  
Required:(Shaker) Amped Up  
Required:(Trump) Limit Break  
Required: Vital, Noble, or Shardless  
Twice Critical’s functionality has evolved through synergy with your abilities to amplify your surroundings and push past your limitations.  
You no longer have a hard limit on how many times you can double your strength, instead your limit is a soft-cap set by your baseline strength, the stronger you are as a baseline, the more boosts you can withstand. You can even go beyond your cap, although doing so causes strain on you which scales with how far past your limits you are. The stamina cost from boosting scales with how many times you’ve boosted. Transferring boosts to others still draws the stamina costs from you, however other beings have their own limits and going past those causes strain to them not you, so don’t give your allies more than they can handle.  
Your capability to transfer boosts has also grown. You can now double specific properties, even those of inanimate objects or phenomena. Double a sword’s sharpness, a shield’s durability, a fire’s heat, or a laser’s power. This is not subject to Amped Up’s limitation of one property per target and you can even spread out a boost across multiple attributes, although the end result is still capped at double the original state. Objects have their own limits based on their quality, however due to their nature they don’t incur much of a stamina cost. You can also spread out a boost across multiple targets to not overwhelm them.  
To give a sense of scale, using multiple boosts on a single property allows you to do things like turning a simple lighter into a conflagration capable of slagging metal and torching entire buildings. Be wary however, as continuous boosting can quickly drain your Shard’s reserves if the boosts get big enough, although Negentropy or Shardless render this a non-issue.  
*Juggernaut Drive*  
Required:Lung  
Your baseline boost softcap scales greater than before, and as your draconic transformation reaches higher and higher levels, your softcap continues to rise while the stamina cost from boosting scales slower. In simpler terms, the more your transformation progresses, the more you can boost and the less it costs to boost. The strength you can gain from this is such that you could fight non-sandbagging Endbringers on even ground and fight entire armies of parahumans with contemptuous ease.

Everything, Everywhere, All At Once  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Clairvoyant  
Required:(Thinker) Full Picture  
The range of your senses expands past the planet, allowing you to extend them to the stars themselves\!  
You no longer have a range limit on your Clairvoyance, allowing you to see everything in every universe simultaneously.  
[(Thinker) Clairvoyant](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.p959w47swxte)

Thread Manipulation  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Master/Striker) Strings  
Required:(Shaker) Razorwire  
Required:(Striker) Property Catalogue  
Required:Spider’s Web  
Your various thread and wire based powers have combined and mutated into a more general Thread Manipulation.  
The speed at which you create thread is vastly accelerated and your efficiency of converting stamina and/or fat stores into thread is similarly enhanced, allowing you to produce vast swathes of thread in the blink of an eye.  
Your ability to alter the properties of thread you create is greatly enhanced, allowing you to imbue threads with capabilities such as immense durability to the point you'd need the strength of Alexandria to break it, regardless of thickness, or the ability to puppet objects and people, turning enemy Parahumans against their allies.  
Lastly, your precision when controlling thread is likewise improved and you gain infinite multitasking when it comes to controlling your thread.  
*Esoteric Threads*  
Required:(Blaster) Debuff  
Required:Conceptual Catalogue  
You have much greater freedom when it comes to modify the properties of the threads you create, and they can be imbued with much more exotic properties such as invisibility, immense sharpness, or the ability to electrify themselves.

Cognoscenti  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Memory Fabrication  
Required:(Tinker) Information Hazard  
Required:(Tinker) Meme  
Required:(Tinker) Information  
Required: Shardless, or Noble  
You've been unshackled, no longer held back by petty limitations. And in doing so, you have become something absolutely terrifying. Your ability to manipulate cognition knows no bounds, your Tinker specialisation being both revered and reviled.  
Your Tinker powers have merged into an all-encompassing specialization centred around the interaction between cognition and information in all its aspects. As a result, you've gained unparalleled insight into manipulating information within minds, how external information can impact psyches and so much more. Any previous limitations, such as range, intensity or complexity, on your cognitive-focused Tinker tech have been entirely removed.  
You could rewrite someone's entire thought process through a video, create memes that can spread globally in days, link everyone across the planet into a unified hivemind, transplant a consciousness into a new body or clone it into a digital existence... almost anything relating to the mind and how it interacts with information can be explored.  
This isn't restricted to human minds either; any being that possesses something akin to consciousness is capable of being affected by your Tinker tech. This even allows you to manipulate the alien cognition of Shards and the Endbringers themselves although the Entities are shielded from this.  
You can create Tinker tech that can produce and replicate almost any form of Stranger or Master effect you can think of with enough effort. This ranges from effects akin to Imp or Cherish to being able to enforce a Master effect as absolute as that of the Administrator Shard. You can even construct information and mind-focused Thinker abilities akin to Über or Tattletale via your tech.  
*Arkhé*  
Required:Archetype Controller  
Your Tinker specialization reaches the cognitive understanding of the archetypical framework of the psyche, which you can use to redefine the very concepts, rationale, and sentimentality of people alongside reframing a mindset or thought process through your Tinker projects.  
You apply fundamental notions, for example, exponentially increasing the potency of Memes, being a vehicle of easily transmissible ideas using archetypes to express the inexpressible; you can implement an archetype with such nuance people are caught unaware of the psychological changes, as the signs characteristic with Master effects aren't easily noticeable or isn't present at all; replicating Master and Stranger effects can include self-enforcing notions, deeper emotional or rational countermeasure increasing efficacy, and a propagating effect which broadens the range and influence.  
Overall, is simply the endpoint of this specialization: changing the very elements of which consciousness uses to understand, parse, and accept information and the world.

Reincarnated as a Slime  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Changer/Trump) Slime  
Required:(Changer/Trump) Kirby  
Required:(Breaker) Immune Response  
Required:(Thinker) Omniscient  
Required: (Changer/Stranger) Human Shapeshift, or (Changer) Self-Biokinesis  
Your slime form evolves to a new level. Your body is now composed of homogeneous cells that can adapt to any tasks required. You lose access to the individual powers and instead your form gains new powers.  
Your body keeps its resistance to all forms of sickness, poison, heat, radiation, electricity, and acid from Immune Response. You also do not feel pain anymore due to the nature of your physiology and gain a degree of resistance to physical attacks.

*Omniscience* evolves and assists the host with a variety of functions.  
Virtual Intelligence: the Shard interacts with the host as a disembodied emotionless voice and can also project complex information directly into the host's mind if necessary. At first, the virtual intelligence will only answer when interacted with but will over time learn from its host and interject when it deems it necessary. The stronger the bond between the Shard and the Host becomes the better the intelligence becomes and might even anticipate the Host's needs at times.  
Appraisal: allows the host to obtain information about a targeted object, being, or phenomenon. The target must be visible to the user to be appraised.  
Knowledge: allows the user to access the Shard's knowledge about the world.  
*Predator* unlocks the Slime form's full potential with a number of abilities.  
Stomach: provides a pocket of storage for materials absorbed and extraneous mass. Quarantine: is a section of the stomach reserved for harmful or waste materials that will be destroyed and converted into extra mass and energy.  
Predation: allows the user to absorb an object or being into themselves and digest them, it is easier to absorb inanimate objects or unconscious beings than conscious ones unless the size difference is great enough. You can also absorb power effects as long as they are tangible (i.e. lasers and force-fields but no Thinker or mind-based Stranger/Master powers). If you absorb and digest a Parahuman's Corona Pollentia and Gemma you can Mimic their powers in full (but it will kill the Parahuman in question). You can release beings that you have absorbed into yourself unharmed if you choose to, however it does not prevent them from being traumatized by the experience.  
Analysis: allows the use of Appraisal to analyze absorbed objects of effects and Mimicry: allows the reproduction of analyzed objects, for beings it allows the host to mimic their form or attributes (as long as sufficient mass is available in storage) or reproduce the objects (as long as the appropriate base materials are available). Mimicry allows shapeshifting into any analyzed shape and even mix-and-match components of multiple shapes, you can also improve and modify them if you have Self-Biokinesis. You can reproduce any tangible power effect you have analyzed however doing so requires concentration which limits how many you can use at once. If you have multiple similar powers (like several different lasers) they will combine into one with the properties of all of them. If you have a Tinker power, you can build objects with Mimicry if you have the requisite base materials or components in your stomach.  
*Virtual Evolution*  
Required:Chaos Creator (Tensura)  
Every story has a beginning and an end. By gaining the power of Rimuru, your Virtual Intelligence has evolved into a Manas, a spiritual life form that exists purely in informational form.  
This has not only enhanced all its previous capabilities, but has also given it free will, though it will still be loyal to you.  
Your new Manas also has the new ability to manipulate infons, tiny particles that exist inside of everything, including souls, powers, and other abstract existences. This allows for it to better understand and optimize your abilities to adapt to a wide range of situations. You can additionally use this to “move” as pure information, allowing you to move while time is stopped and resist other trump powers.  
Additionally, you can allow your manas to take over your body in order to perform complex tasks or have it control one of your available minions.

Time Jack  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:(Breaker/Trump) Energy Well  
Required:(Shaker/Striker) Time Magic\!  
Required:(Thinker) Perfect Timing  
Your capacity to end something by accelerating it expands into Acceleration, Deacceleration, and Reversal. While you can still use it on yourself, on things you are touching and on your powers your capacity to use it on anything you can see is replaced by using it on anything the energy from your energy well permeates. Accelerating, Deaccelarating and Reversal all cause a glitch-like effect on what they are being used on.  
Acceleration: allows you to speed up the time of something. Functions almost like the original Time Magic, but while the original would stop accelerating someone who wanted to raise their hand the moment it made them complete the action you could continue accelerating them.

Deacceleration: allows you to slow down the time of something. This can be used to delay and stop things, aging? Slow it down to live a little longer, a barrage of projectiles is coming towards you? Blast a wave of energy in their direction to slow down their motion.  
Reversal: allows you to reverse the time of something. This can be used to repair objects, heal injuries, bring the dead back to before they died and etc.

You can accelerate/decelerate/reverse the time of something as far you want but the more you go below/above 10x the original speed (for acceleration/deceleration) or before 10 minutes (for reversal) the more of a headache you build up, go over the limit too much and you might die of brain damage. You can expend energy from your well to go beyond the limit without gaining a headache or dying, but acceleration will consume much less energy than deceleration and reversal due to time’s nature of always moving forwards. Negentropy removes this drawback.  
(Shaker/Striker) Time Magic\!  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can make something end quickly by accelerating it. You can do this on what you can see, on yourself and what you are touching or on your powers. What is affected by your power will age faster by the same rate you accelerated it.  
Accelerate an arriving plane and it will quickly go from flying to landing, accelerate the cooldown of a power and it will decrease until it is skipped entirely, accelerate the decay of something and it might just break if it was close to happening, accelerate healing and it will quickly finish.  
You can accelerate something as fast as you want to but the more you surpass 10x the original speed the more of a headache you build up, go fast enough and you might die of brain damage. Negentropy removes this limit.

Time Windows  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Shaker) Phir Sē  
Required:(Mover) Door Me  
Required: Negentropy, or Shardless  
Your portals can lead to anywhere within time, doesn't matter if it is the past, present or future. Conditions from Door Me still apply, so you can't go to somewhere within 1997 Paris without first seeing that somewhere in Paris. Portals can be made anywhere where you can see or around you.  
You can freely change the shape and color of your portals, like an empty rectangle with blue edges that allows you to see the other side or a full golden hexagon that blocks sight.  
Those portals last indefinitely and the replacement of a Past/Future self is now optional.  
*Understanding Time*  
Required:(Thinker) Clairvoyant  
Required:Comprehension  
You can extend your senses through time. All possibilities are within your reach, what was/is/will/could be are but a portal away.  
Together with this you instinctively know blurry details of something you could sense within the Past or Future and its timeframe, look at a password protected door and you will see a faint outline of someone typing the password a hour ago, touch your skin and you can vaguely feel a stab wound that will happen tomorrow and etc.  
You also have a conscious and unconscious knowledge of everything that is/will be/can be. You know every detail of why someone is the way they are, you know who will die and who will live, you know why someone tripping on a rock was essential for the birth of a villain etc.

Ever Evolving Tech  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Stranger) Tech Shutdown  
Required: (Shaker/Striker) Mechanicus Aura, or (Striker) Renewal  
Through destruction comes creation; in your case, improvement. Any technology that fails under your power will now be reworked based on improvements specifically addressing its points of failure after being fixed by this power. These improvements are permanent and manifest physically, allowing a Tinker or researcher to observe the changes.  
Every flaw will be exploited—from material properties to code/software to the synergy of esoteric effects such as enchantments. Each repair eliminates these weaknesses, only for the tech to break again in new ways. These reworks do not gain immunity to Tech Shutdown effects unless you explicitly demand it, however, doing so, will significantly hinder or stop the technology’s ability to further improve through this power.

Dreamscape  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Stranger/Breaker) Hitchhike  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Sandman  
You possess the ability to enter people's minds, delving into their subconscious and whispering to them, altering their thought process. While they sleep, you can invade their dreams, seize control, and link their dreams to others. You can extract objects or creatures from these dreams and manifest them in the physical world. These dream-born creations are composed of shifting sand, mimicking their original appearance with a slightly altered texture. They retain the powers they had in the dream, albeit slightly weakened, with a maximum of three powers worth up to 5 SP each.  
*Fear Avatars*  
Required:Pitch Black  
You can enter the minds of others, either personally or through your creations, to instill and amplify fear. Your power allows you to craft creatures that embody specific phobias, targeting the deepest fears within your victims. These creatures are called Nightmares. For example, you can conjure a serpentine creature to torment someone with ophidiophobia, its slithering form haunting their every thought. Similarly, you might create a shadowy figure that preys on someone’s fear of the dark, its presence an ever-looming terror that plunges them into paralyzing dread. These fear-crafted entities are not only tailored to the individual's nightmares but are also capable of persisting in the real world, their sand-like forms shifting ominously as they pursue their targets.  
*Corrupted Fear*  
Required:Pitch Black  
Required:(Master) Uncanny Valley  
Your mastery over fear has evolved, enabling you to gradually transform individuals into fear-addicted beings who crave both the experience and infliction of terror. To do so, you have to have either one of your creations or yourself stay within the mind of your target. As their minds succumb to this corruption, they begin to develop a new ability: a temporary surge in strength when causing or experiencing fear. They may also slowly gain weak powers based on the fear the Nightmare embodies, if it embodies any at all. The powers will be based on whatever power you have if you are the one staying in their mind. The powers gained tend to be support powers, made to amplify their already existing abilities.  
However, this descent into fear addiction comes at a cost. As they become more corrupted, their threshold for fear increases, making it increasingly difficult for them to achieve the same rush. This compels them to escalate their actions, seeking more extreme and perilous situations to attain their high. This relentless pursuit of fear ultimately traps them in a vicious cycle, pushing them to ever greater extremes in their quest for that fleeting, intoxicating rush of strength.  
They will become fanatically loyal to you, causing fear in your name. Every time they absorb fear, a portion will also go to you.  
*Phobos*  
Required:(Changer) Daymare  
Required:(Stranger) Spooky  
Required:Pitch Black  
Required:(Master) Uncanny Valley  
Your Nightmares now possess the ability to absorb fear from anyone who specifically fears them, regardless of distance. They also gain a small amount of power whenever someone experiences fear related to what they embody. For example, a Nightmare representing the fear of heights will siphon a bit of fear energy each time someone feels afraid of heights. If this Nightmare possesses a person, that person will also benefit from the fear absorption, although it will further corrupt their mind.  
You can also freely enter the dreams of people who fear you, regardless of distance, however, it is limited to only projecting your mind in their dream, limiting the degree of influence you have. By staying and corrupting your target's mind enough, you can fully possess them, using your powers, as well as their own, through them.  
In addition, you have acquired a new ability: the power to temporarily embody specific fears. By absorbing these specific fears, you can gain unique enhancements and abilities. For instance, by absorbing the fear of arachnophobia, you might develop the agility and venomous strike of a spider, while embodying claustrophobia could grant you the power to manipulate space, creating confining barriers around your enemies. You can also create Nightmares that embody these fears, have them absorb fear before devouring them. This method however will not be as effective, although admittedly will be easier.

Pitch Black  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Fear  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Sandman  
You have the ability to summon black sand constructs that manifest from the fears of others. These creatures can sense and absorb fear, which nourishes and strengthens them. They can also physically enter the minds of others, whispering doubts and fears while haunting their dreams. The stronger they are, the more realistic they look. Strictly speaking, there is no limit to the number of fear constructs you can create. However, if there are too many and insufficient fear to sustain them, they will weaken and perish, or worse, turn on you to feed on your fear. The further away they are from you, the more fear they need to sustain themselves.  
*The Boogeyman*  
Required:(Changer) Daymare  
Required:(Stranger) Spooky  
Your form has further improved, allowing you to gain minor powers the more fear you have absorbed. You no longer have a range at which you have to absorb from, they just have to fear you specifically, allowing you to even gain the fear of people on the other side of the globe. This means that as long as someone anywhere in the world is afraid of you or your creations, their fear adds to your strength. As you absorb more fear, you gain additional minor abilities that make you even more formidable. These abilities are mostly support abilities, made to enhance your already existing abilities.  
The more fear you gather, the more versatile and potent these minor powers become. This continuous cycle of absorbing fear and gaining power allows you to cast a wide net of influence, instilling dread and gathering even more fear from every corner of the world. Your ever-growing powers make you a figure of global terror, drawing strength from the fear of countless individuals who may never even see you but feel your presence in their darkest moments.  
*Fear Monger*  
Required:(Stranger) Spooky  
Your creations can absorb the fear of those who encounter them, altering their appearance to look more real and less like black sand sculptures. When they absorb fear, they gain minor powers related to the type of fear and their appearance. For example, a figure that looks like a shadowy person might gain the ability to move silently and blend into the darkness. A doll with cracked features could make small objects move and whisper unsettling thoughts. A swarm of insects might control real insects and paralyze people with a bite. A mirror could create spooky reflections and show ghostly images from the past. A tree might trip people with its roots and make eerie noises. These powers are small but make the creations more frightening and effective at scaring people, creating a cycle where they grow slightly stronger as they absorb more fear. The more powerful your creations become, the less fear they need to sustain themselves, thus allowing them to survive further away from you.  
*Nightmare*  
Required:(Changer) Daymare  
Your changer state has transformed, becoming a shifting pillar of black sand. You can freely morph your appearance into fearsome monsters made of black sand and an eerie glow, allowing you to adapt to any situation. You can sense and absorb fear of those around you, using it to permanently increase your strength and enhance any other power you have, either boosting its raw strength, increasing in versatility or removing their restrictions.  
(Master/Thinker) Fear  
Cost: 4 SP  
You have knowledge on how to cause fear. You can know anyone’s fear with just a glance and the perfect way to make them feel fear. You can manipulate those who are afraid, making them unknowingly act as you wish. You can, with relative ease, traumatize people, permanently scarring them. Doing so allows you to place a permanent order in their subconscious. This works best when used on a single person at once, but can still be used on a crowd.  
(Master/Thinker) Sandman  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can create intangible sand-like constructs that cause those who come into contact with them to fall asleep. You are able to manipulate the dreams and nightmares of your targets, allowing you to induce pleasant or horrifying dreams. You can control the dreamscape itself, crafting any situation or environment you desire, and the individuals experiencing these dreams will feel as though they are actually there. You can also access the unconscious minds of their targets, giving them insight into their deepest desires, fears, and memories.  
[(Changer) Daymare](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.z988u1c9n71e)

Background Character  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:Stranger (Weakling)  
Required:(Stranger) Average Joe  
You are, or at least appear to be, entirely average. People rarely notice you, and even if they do, they quickly forget. To most, you seem utterly ordinary and forgettable. No one associates anything noteworthy with you. Even if you were to destroy an entire city and sit atop a pile of corpses, no one would believe you were responsible. They will not be able to believe that you have powers, since you are completely average.  
You can toggle this effect on and off.  
*Just Another Day*  
Required:(Stranger) You Are A Dragon And That's Okay  
Now, the effects of your stranger power extend to events caused by or related to you. For example, if you destroyed the moon, no one would find it surprising—just another day to them. You can telekinetically control objects in front of people, and they will consider it completely normal. If you master someone, people will just think you have great charisma. Even if you create tinkertech, people will view it as unusually stubborn tech that is difficult, if not impossible, to replicate. They won't associate it, or you, with tinkertech.  
(Stranger) Average Joe  
Cost: 5 SP  
You blend in with any nearby crowds. Unless they're already on edge, any group you join won't realize you don't belong.  
(Stranger) You Are A Dragon And That's Okay  
Cost: 3 SP  
No matter what your form or appearance is, people will consider it unremarkable.  
This doesn't prevent people from recognizing parts of your body that aren't the norm (such as obviously being a robot or having blades for hands), they just won't judge you for that fact and consider it just another normal trait anybody can have, like having blue eyes or being a bit short. This effect extends to photographs, video or even verbal descriptions of your body.  
This also doesn’t lead to people not noticing the effects of your strange biology on the world: if you’re constantly damp, and they see you leaving wet spots everywhere, people will still get annoyed at you; if your skin is acidic, people will try to avoid directly touching you; if you’re bigger than a building then people won’t automatically assume you’ll fit inside; etc. They just won’t consider these effects particularly unusual.  
This only applies to your form, automatic power usage that is part of your form and any power usage necessary for normal day-to-day life if your form prevents you from doing those things the normal way. If you’re made out of fire people won’t find it weird, but if you then start shooting that fire out of your hands or flying around any more than the minor amount necessary for you to do things a mundane person can do, people will react to it normally.

The Chrysalis King  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:Nilbog  
Required:(Changer/Trump) Metamorphosis  
Your ability to construct cocoons has merged with the sacs generated by Nilbog, further expanding what you are capable of. You can now freely place down sacs instead of having them attached to your body, retaining full awareness and control over them, no matter the distance. You can produce and place three different types of sacs for a specific task; a sac to entrap a target and convert them into biological slurry, a sac which can uptake this biological matter to produce new monsters and finally, a cocoon-like sac.  
The cocoon-like sac can hold any carbon-based creatures, such as animals, humans or your monsters, and then modify them. This initially involves rapidly healing injuries and curing diseases in under 20 minutes before then continuously optimising, enhancing and expanding the creature's physiological and mental state, alongside any powers or abilities that they might possess. This is a slow process but the effects are permanent.  
The longer a creature is in a sac, the more powerful it can become although this eventually levels out, limiting any creature to being equal in strength to the strongest parahumans. The cocoon-like sac requires biological matter in order to undergo these processes and you're able to direct the outcome of these processes to a limited extent.  
*Snare Sacs Snacks*  
Required:Mimic  
The 'trap' sacs which imprison and dissolve targets are now fully compatible with the tinkertech that you can construct through Mimic. Any tinkertech that you create via Mimic can automatically be integrated into and used by your 'trap' sacs when you produce and place them down. You can even use your monster-making sacs to produce biological versions of your tinkertech 'mimics'. Note that you have to construct the tinkertech before you can produce 'trap' sacs or 'mimics' with biological versions of that tinkertech.  
For instance, you could potentially create a semi-sentient 'trap' sac that is disguised as a vending machine in its passive state before it transforms, quickly devouring any unlucky target in its way and then converting them into biomatter for you to use.  
*Phylogenesis*  
Required:(Striker) Mutagen   
The mutagen that you produce is now an inherent aspect of your cocoon-like sacs, enveloping the subject held within the sac. The dramatic effect this has on the capabilities of the sac is twofold.  
Firstly, the mutagen's ability to induce rapid, optimised evolution massively speeds up the sac's normal rate of enhancing the creature's physiology alongside their abilities. Secondly, you can now fully control how the creature in the sac evolves and is enhanced, from forcing its powers to evolve down a specific possible route to altering the creature's final form and traits to make it more suitable for a specific environment. You no longer have any limit to how strong any of your creatures can become but you still require enough biological matter and mutagen for the changes to occur.  
Nilbog  
Cost: 14 SP  
You can create minions by recycling pre-existing living material. You can customize these minions with feelings and powers of their own, allowing for a vast array of shapes and forms. Your monsters can breed and give birth to more monsters.  
To create a monster, you enclose a target in one of your generated sacs. The target can try to fight free, but once enclosed, their biological material is passed through your body into another sac, where it's transformed into a slurry. This mixture of living matter can be used to create new monsters.

Endless Reflection  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:(Thinker/Breaker) For The Want Of A Nail  
Required:(Breaker/Trump) Ignis Fatuus  
Your power has grown to allow you to view every version of yourself simultaneously, as well as extending it to any thing or beings you touch. Each version of You is intrinsically loyal to you regardless of how much they deviate from you and each other. You can allow them to communicate with you and each other.  
You no longer simply overlay another version of yourself, instead your flickering ability operates as normal allowing you to freely swap any parts of yourself and those you touch to any other state or version. From freely swapping what powers you have available to healing oneself. Your flickering can now also be applied to those being viewed through For The Want Of A Nail, allowing you to do things such as heal them or even teleport them.  
Your flickering ability can now operate without any conscious thought, automatically shifting to desired states and powers. Break your arm and find it immediately shifted to a healed state, your location immediately shifting as soon as you want it to, find yourself wanting blue hair and if you’d look in the mirror you’d see it. This only operates on what you’d want to happen, neither surprising nor backfiring, simply removing the need for any conscious thought.  
The realities from For The Want Of A Nail are valid targets for your flickering, allowing you to for example turn an enemy from your reality into a friend from a reality where they are one.  
The slots of Ignis Fatuus have also grown tremendously, either growing to hold powers thrice as powerful as before with a single slot or equal to the total strength of your combined powers, whichever is greater. While this can be used to swap and choose powers as normal, this also allows you to place an alternate You’s powers inside, allowing you to use their abilities without having to swap out your own. Your Ignis Fatuus slots have grown to 3 (5 with Negentropy/Shardless). Holding the same power among multiple slots or fusing slots will dramatically increase the shared power, your own abilities also count towards this increase.  
*Paradigm Shift*  
Required:(Trump) Aliena  
Required:Engine of Escalation  
Required:Paradigm  
Your ability to flicker has greatly been amplified, allowing you to hold overlay multiple versions onto something at the same time. You can overlay up to 10 (15 if Shardless/Negentropic) versions onto something at the same time, and you can choose specific features of each verison to carry over, merge, or be held back as you wish. You do not have to be actively viewing another possibility to use their abilities for yourself. You can choose whether you shift to match alternate versions or not and your alterations are permanent and instant, unless shifted back.  
Your more powerful Ignis Fatuus aspect merges with Harmonic Engine, massively increasing Paradigm’s pool of power by 3 (5 if Shardless/Negentropic). Instead of losing your Ignis Slots to Paradigm, they reconstitute themselves becoming available for use again, without weakening Paradigm, and increasing to 10 (15 if Shardless/Negentropic). Their overall power is increased to hold equal to the total strength of your combined powers. You can also freely summon other versions of yourself if you wish. You can also directly fuse them with Paradigm to increase it's power further, and unfuse them as you wish.  
[Ignis Fatuus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.5h8vxssjw6ho)  
(Thinker/Breaker) For The Want Of A Nail  
Cost: 20 SP  
You’ve gained the ability to view alternate realities by posing “What If?” questions, allowing you to view a vast range of possibilities. From something as simple as you having made a different choice to something entirely unrelated to yourself. This can range from questions such as “What if I hadn’t gone out yesterday?”, “What if I had Triggered with Alexandria’s powers?”, “What if science had a massive breakthrough that skyrocketed technological advancements 1000 years prior?”, and much more, those questions can include multiple deviations. You can view up to 10 separate realities at the same time.  
Regardless of what differences there are, you’ll always view it through the senses of an alternate version of You, as well as possessing a fundamental understanding of how it came to be. You’ll be able to experience each reality with no more difficulty than you would just own.  
Each reality and beings within them have an identifier, a name that describes the deviation. By using that identifier you can ask What If questions using Alternate Realities/Selves as a base.  
The access to those realities are kept on a mental archive within your mind, allowing you to access them yet again if you switch from a reality to another and wish to go back. Asking the question that made that reality will make another variation for possibilities are endless.  
You can pick one alternate version of yourself that you are viewing and can overlay that version of You onto yourself, gaining access to any deviations they have. This will allow you to utilize any abilities those alternates of you possess, as well as any equipment they have. When transformed your true body will slowly shift to match that of your alternate you, this can be both detrimental as well as beneficial. This shift is incredibly gradual and will entirely reverse if the change is held less than a day.  
*The Dagda*  
Required:(Trump) Manager  
Required:(Trump) Oberon  
When you turn into an Alternate Self you automatically copy their powers and can choose to steal them. You can also do the reverse, give them a power you have taken/copied.  
Oberon and Manager fuse into one inheriting each other's strengths and covering their weaknesses. You can store an infinite amount of powers and use 10 (14 with Negentropy) of them simultaneously, compatible powers synergize and amplify each other and can occupy the same slot.  
A power will temporarily become stronger the more versions of it you can use. As an example, the same power through Overlay, Copy and Taken triples all of its aspects.  
*Skill Up*  
Required:(Thinker) Polymath  
Required: (Trump) Oberon, or (Trump) Manager  
Any skills you have through an Alternate Self is elevated to the highest possible level. Using a Skill from an Alternate Self together with the same Skill from Polymath elevates it beyond the limit, becoming a power, the elevation of a high enough skill from an Alternate Self will not need a duplicate skill for it to become a power.. You could cut titanium with a stick through Swordsmanship, shoot bullets that never miss with Marksmanship or create superpowered medicine through Apothecary. The strength of those powers scale with any power boosters you have without you even needing to use the power booster. Those powers are affected by Oberon/Manager the same way any other power is, you can't steal them with Manager but you can still copy them.  
You can slot Thinker and Tinker powers from your Alternate Selves into a Polymath slot.  
Any Thinker and Tinker powers you have that didn't come from Skill Up will have all their aspects doubled.

Cornerstone  
Cost: 13 SP  
Required: Dauntless, or Shawn  
Required:(Thinker/Trump) Networking  
Required:Network 2.0  
The ensuing synthesis of these powers’ synergies creates an odd result: A Network (with you as a focal point and moderating force) facilitating and ensuring power functionality and effectivity within the Network’s members.  
Retaining their previous functionalities and interactions, this offers far-out operations based on the idea of a “cornerstone”: With you acting as a center point, you’re capable of modulating, enhancing, and improving your Network members’ innate and shared powers facilitating concurrency and synergy between them, allowing flexibility between compatible powers, reducing power restrictions and the like through distributing and optimizing your Network members’ collective energy reservoirs and enabling pings between Shards in the Network.  
Your Networking hence evolves into simulating a Firmament simulation composed of your Network members.  
Network 2.0  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Trump) Network Hub  
Your network has been upgraded, with your hub in particular being significantly improved: Your hub members may each access seven powers with zero loss in strength, while you in particular may use up to twelve without any power loss, and potentially up to twenty-five. For each power past the twelfth, you incur a slowly-increasing penalty in their strength, capping out at 50% for a full set.  
Should you happen to also have Negentropy, then your hub members may access ten powers, and you may access the full twenty-five powers without any more loss in strength.  
(Trump) Network Hub  
Cost: 15 SP  
When you touch a Parahuman, they become part of your network. Members of the network can access the powers connected to the network at 80% strength. A member can at most use five powers at once. As the hub you can use up to twenty at once, however the more powers you have active the weaker they become (down by 20% for each set of 5 with a minimum of 20%). You can create partitions in the network and restrict which powers each member has access to but you cannot restrict access to a member's own power. Even if a member is alone in a partition, they still have knowledge they are part of the network and gain the ability to swap their power but will only feel an empty catalog of powers to draw from. This allows them to turn off their power by swapping for an empty slot.  
(Thinker/Trump) Networking  
Cost: 7 SP  
With a single touch, you can connect people to your network, allowing them to draw power and knowledge from the collective. Each individual becomes a node in the network, pooling their skills and senses to form a powerful force. Senses include but are not limited to: spatial awareness, power granted senses, ordinary 5 senses, and more. Those in the network also gain a minor multitasking ability so that they can make use of the additional senses with no problems.  
There is a limitation, the effectiveness of the connection gradually weakens as the individual moves further away from other members of the network. As a result, it becomes harder for individuals to access the shared skills and senses, and vice versa.  
*Networked Networking*  
Required:(Trump) Network Hub  
When individuals are connected through the network hub, the effects of the skill/sense share do not degrade with distance like they normally would. In addition, this also grants a limited ability to telepathically speak to one another.  
*Interconnected Networking*  
Required:Network 2.0  
Individuals within the network continue to build upon their skills and experience, their own skills and experience interacting and fusing with the skills and experience of the network, forming something new. With the constant growth and exchange of skills and knowledge in your network, you have the potential to continually improve your abilities and find new ways to apply them. Over time, you may develop ways to work around power limitations or discover new applications for your powers, expanding your repertoire and increasing your effectiveness in combat or other tasks. This growth does not increase the raw strength or power of your abilities, but rather improves the user's ability to use them skillfully and effectively.  
*Hive Network*  
Required:(Master) Hive Mind  
The network has mutated in an interesting way, individuals within it have become even more closely connected. The network's mutated state has allowed for the sharing of memories, thoughts, and experiences among all connected minds, creating a collective consciousness that enables everyone to act as one cohesive unit. This new level of coordination has made it possible to learn skills and abilities at an unprecedented rate, and it has also increased the efficiency of communication and teamwork within the network. The more members or clones that join the network, the greater the potential for rapid learning and skill acquisition, as the collective knowledge and expertise of the network becomes available to all.  
Quartermaster  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Trump) Soulmate  
Soulmate has upgraded, you can now hand out to 10 (15 with Negentropy/Shardless) copies of any powers and power related perks you have to anyone. You only need to know either what they look like or their name to do so. You will never give a power to someone you didn’t mean to. You can take back any power you have at any time, and those you give out powers cannot stop you from doing so regardless of other factors. Your own powers and perks trump any you give them unless you would wish otherwise. You choose what power/perks or combination of powers and perks you give out, meaning you can give one person a single power and someone else another, as long as you don’t hand out more copies than you have. Those you have given powers/perks will retain them up until you have taken them back, meaning they can keep them after your death if you do not recollect them by then. Powers you have handed out cannot be used negatively against you unless you would wish it to.  
*Basic Set*  
Required:(Striker/Trump) Perk  
You can hand out any number of personal and power related perks and drawbacks that you have or have had to those who possess at least one power handed out by Quartermaster. If you take back all powers you have given them, then they lose any perks you have given them as well. Your amount of copies is increased to 15 (30 with Negentropy/Shardless). You still retain your limit of copies that you can hand out without powers.  
*Supply Chain*  
Required:Network 2.0  
Whenever someone enters your hub, you gain a permanent copy of their ability for yourself and additional copies to hand to others. You can share as many powers/perks as you wish among those in your hub.  
*General*  
Required:(Master/Trump) Gestation  
You may optionally have your power slowly change those you have given out powers to, slowly shifting them into your perfect companions. You may instead optionally allow your power to simply enforce absolute loyalty on those you have affected, or simply not affect them at all if you wish. This can be done on a case by case basis and can be changed at any time. You have a subconscious awareness of the location of all those within your network, and are able to freely set up and allow telepathic communication between members, and can also summon and teleport members to each other’s location, you included. You can extend these capabilities to anyone you have gifted a power/perk to. If and when you choose to release someone, the changes you have made remain, although they are no longer maintained by your power and as such those affected can change their loyalty and behavior as they normally would.  
(Note: If you have taken any companions from the companion section or followers of some other kind, you may optionally choose to apply the effects of General upon entry to any of them, granting any combination it could grant that you wish, up to your power’s limit. If you would wish your power to shift them into your perfect companions, you can opt for it to have already been done so.)  
*The Endless Horde*  
Required:Endless Reserves  
Your allotted copies are now endless, you may hand out as many copies of anything you can hand out, in whatever combination you wish. You can recall these at will as normal.

Mimic  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Camouflage  
Required:Tinker/Stranger (Faker)  
Your tinkertech has evolved, now imbued with a life of its own. It can now take on the guise of other objects, seamlessly blending into its surroundings with uncanny precision. Whether it assumes the form of a living chest, a sentient firearm, or even a sentient house, its ability to mimic the appearance of mundane objects is truly remarkable.  
In its stationary state, your tinkertech becomes virtually indistinguishable from its non-living counterparts, making it the ultimate tool for camouflage and deception. In its active state, it sprouts flesh-like tendrils that writhe with life, secreting specialized acids capable of dissolving even the most resilient of obstacles. Meanwhile, bone-like protrusions emerge, fashioned into teeth that gnash with an unsettling hunger. It morphs from an ordinary object into a grotesque mimicry of life itself. A chest-like form becomes a gaping maw, lined with rows of razor-sharp teeth, ready to rend and tear at a moment's notice.  
Moreover, you can add unique appendages onto your tech. This ranges from an acid shooter capable of unleashing corrosive torrents, or an electrical tendril crackling with potent energy. Other ideas are the ability to merge with its counterparts, forming a formidable collective entity, greater than the sum of its parts. Another idea you could add is a minor space expansion within its stomach, allowing it to eat beings far bigger than itself.  
[(Tinker) Camouflage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.kpiz7ju1bkw3)

Electro-Magneto  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Shaker) Electromagnetic Warping  
Required:(Shaker/Blaster) Magnets, Son\! How do they work?  
Your powers have combined, augmenting each other to empower you into becoming the preeminent authority over the fundamental force of electromagnetism.  
As such, your range when instantaneously generating and manipulating electromagnetic fields has subsequently expanded to 1000 meters. Your passive defensive shield has also improved, protecting you from any electromagnetic-based attacks by either deflecting or simply just negating them.  
You possess an enhanced electromagnetic sense giving you absolute awareness of all electromagnetic fields within your expanded range. This awareness combined with your advanced knowledge of electromagnetism enables you to easily manipulate these fields with astounding finesse and skill. From manipulating electromagnetic radiation to producing lightning with ease, you are now the master of electromagnetism.  
[(Shaker/Blaster) Magnets, Son\! How do they work?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.jrnkcq3xdfd7)  
(Shaker) Electromagnetic Warping  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can slowly manipulate electromagnetic fields, allowing you to warp the surroundings in anomalous ways. This would allow you to levitate objects, induce electric currents, or even create illusions. There is a somatic component to this power, requiring that you gradually bend and layer electromagnetic fields with your bare hands. This grants advanced knowledge of electromagnetism, as well as a basic electromagnetic sense with which you may perceive the world. Due to your manipulation's slow and somatic nature, this power is not feasible for fast-paced combat.

Optimum  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Path to Victory  
Required: (Thinker) Vision, or Comprehension  
Using the budding endeavors of an Entity putting their insight into a Power, Path to Victory, and Vision fuses and evolves with a new purpose: to foster and utilize innovation and creativity. This has two functionalities:  
Using Path to Victory’s prior mechanics of gazing at all possible strands of time to search a single timeline where one goal is achieved to act on it, this does the same for a widely different purpose. It looks into all probable timelines at any point in time to investigate and experiment for novel and unorthodox ideas and courses of action to a problem or situation that either progress or optimize your effectivity, personally speaking; instead of focusing on one path, this accounts for more nuanced variables, and circumstances diverging to a multitude of paths flexibilizing your power. For example, in the circumstance of fighting Scion, this part offers a comprehensive view of the multiple old and new avenues, and visualizes it more as a conceptual diagram which is then used as pointers instead of a set of steps and letting your power take the driving seat.  
Utilizing Vision’s simulation capabilities, this is improved to boot. This applies broadly to any scenario possible on a larger scale, considering every possibility with a heightened fidelity and quality close to perfection through planet-wide scanning and detection of all components and factors and temporal perception (although it’s seldom used), as their interactions and interconnections between them. The simulations help with the continuous use and refinement of the power, with each use the power learns better methods and procedures to improve itself.  
This is, finally, the culmination of searching for a new horizon and using the importance of innovation to one’s advantage.  
*The Pleroma of One: Agent of the World*  
Required:Inland Empire  
Required:Fractured Psyche  
Your Revelation and Faded Whole supports Optimum. Optimum uses your fragments and insight to go beyond the veil of every alternative, possibility, and secret the World offers, simulate any component, and then implement it on your psyche. It’s almost as if you mend yourself with the World, being more and more of it, reforming yourself into a memorial of experiences and echoes. With enough time this shapes into other powers, physical and mental abilities, and skills allusive to a part of your psychology through the usage of Optimum’s \[Data\] for modeling a power expression capable of solving a problem close to your heart conclusively. The power’s potency, versatility, and scope depend on the fragment it latches on, for instance, your insecurity, confidence, framework, or guilt, among others.  
[Comprehension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.w4r3pe6ks1gv)

Quantum  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Laplace Demon  
Required: Kid Cassandra, or Dinah Alcott  
Your power has evolved from a percentage-based precognition to a general quantum computation to model anything. This is best explained as using quantum computing to build models and designs for various outcomes. The more accurate and better the information you get your hands on, the better the accuracy of your estimations. This ranges from combat/battlefield calculation, and general timing, short and long-term pre/post/pericognition, to information gathering or anything that is estimated or evaluated.  
How you engage with this is rather distinct: Instead of asking questions that are answered by a percentage about an outcome or event, in Kid Cassandra's case, this grows into a more involved process where you "figure it out" yourself, which allows you to see the "whys" and "hows" of the percentages.  
This results in being capable of answering any questions as long as it is calculable.  
Kid Cassandra  
Cost: 11 SP  
You can predict the future as percentages. Doing so too much will give you headaches.

Power Cultivator  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:(Trump) Growth Booster  
Required:(Trump) Power Seed  
Your abilities to plant, grow and boost powers have coalesced together to transform you into an incredible cultivator of powers, both in others and yourself.  
Your enhanced ability to plant power seeds now causes them to start at 2 SP instead, growing and budding at a rate of 2 SP a week before finally maturing at a total of 20 SP. Similarly, boosting your own and others' powers also causes them to grow at an improved rate of 2 SP a week up to a maximum of twice the original SP cost of the power.  
You can boost powers you've planted but only after they've either finished maturing or you've taken the power back, with each individual only being able to have one power being boosted at a time. For example, you could plant a power seed, let it finish maturing at 20 SP before then boosting it up to be equivalent to 40 SP although completing this entire process would take you a significant amount of time.  
Finally, you're now capable of planting and growing a single 2 SP power seed at a time within yourself. The budding, maturing and boosting of this power seed follows the same constraints for you as for other individuals. Note that you're still limited to only having one power of your choice operating at 100% with the rest being at 50%.  
[(Trump) Power Seed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.4c812yyn45d5)  
(Trump) Growth Booster  
Cost: 8 SP  
You may give either yourself or someone else an enhanced growth rate for one of their powers. The boosted power grows at a rate of 1 SP/week, up to a max of twice the original SP cost. It will grow based on the owner's actions and experiences, and will try to suit their needs similar to Dynamist Jr. Using the power on someone else requires both physical touch and consent. Each person can only have one growth booster at a time, and they may not have a power boosted if it has already been boosted to the limit. You may grant boosters to an unlimited amount of people, and can remove boosters at will.

Chaotic Tinker  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required: Bakuda, or (Tinker) Destruction  
Required:String Theory  
Required:(Tinker) Absurdity  
Your Tinker power’s specialization is now geared to causing the most amount of chaos possible, with a bigger and boggling scale to boot. In place of a countdown, you now possess a sense of a place’s stability and security; the more concord and order a place has, the less effective your power is in projects, designs, and functionality.  
What’s the solution? You burn the house down, of course\!  
The more chaotic your actions are, with your tinkertech or simply yourself, or how catastrophic your surroundings are, your power rewards you with loosening its knowledge, giving more inspiration plus allowing you to tinker more easily. The projects you tinker with are colored by the element that enhances the power: Chaos. Bombs or knick-knacks capable of mind bending disorder, destructive megaprojects able to upend the world through sheer havoc, gadgets (or just about anything) with no drop of sense as to what it does or why it does what it does, to say a few. Scion only knows of the mayhem you’ll bring.  
String Theory  
Cost: 13 SP  
You are a tinker with almost no limitations regarding what you can build. However, all of your creations work on a countdown from the moment construction begins, requiring careful time management and sufficient resources in order to achieve the best results. When time or resources are insufficient, your creations will backfire like Leet.  
You tinker noticeably faster than other tinkers and can create specialized drones to do construction for you.  
(Tinker) Absurdity  
Cost: 8 SP  
You don't create cars that drive on wheels or float, or even drive at all. Your cars are able to spin their way to any destination, at blazing speeds.  
What about a gun? Well, this gun doesn't even shoot. Instead, it calls upon a strike of lightning\! Regardless, your 'specialization' is utterly absurd. Your inventions do completely ridiculous things instead of what they're meant to do.  
A tank that uses its barrel to fly into the air? Why not? A sword that can spin, the rotational force causing it to fire 9mm parabellum? Sure. How about a generator that reduces power instead? Okay. It's all there.

Forgotten Call  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Shaker/Stranger) Call of Oblivion  
Required:(Stranger/Master) Identity  
Should anyone die under the influence of your song, not only will all information about them be erased, but they will also be revived as a featureless humanoid creature that you can control. They will retain any skill or power they have in life.  
(Shaker/Stranger) Call of Oblivion  
Cost: 25 SP  
Anything that hears you sing has their perception of you erased; this affects any senses, even power-granted ones. They can't see, smell, hear, or even feel you. Do note that even if someone can't feel their hands touching your face, they can still feel their own hand being stopped by something.  
Your singing can also make someone act upon their intrusive thoughts; someone driving could end up hitting a tree because they thought of it or jumping off a cliff.  
Anyone killed by you, be it directly or indirectly, has memories of them erased from this world. Their parents do not recognize the face on the pictures of their house, and their significant other can't seem to remember who they lived with.  
(This doesn't work through recordings or electronics; it also can't affect entities.)  
(Stranger/Master) Identity  
Cost: 25 SP  
After touching your target for a minute, you are capable of erasing your target's existence, including other people's memories of them and all traces of their identity in the form of photos, documents, and the like, preserving only your own memories of the target. This does not have an inherent protection from keeping others from noticing that they have lost their memories.  
After you have erased their existence, the target becomes a featureless humanoid creature that you can control. This creature retains any skills or powers the target had. The target’s mind will be trapped in a room where they can experience everything their transformed body is experiencing.  
You can undo this control, returning them to their original state and making all information of their existence return.

Scry And Die  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:(Mover/Thinker) Blink and you Miss it.  
Required:(Thinker) Byakugan  
Required:Thinker/Master (Autopilot)  
The awareness of Blink And You Miss It and Byakugan are merged, granting you absolute awareness of everything within 35 meters of yourself and the capacity to teleport anything anywhere within 34 meters of yourself. You no longer have a cooldown for your teleportation.  
You can send your awareness to anywhere you can see/think of/visualize, though doing that means your awareness no longer surrounds you, meaning that if you are using it to watch something happening in another country you won't know about the thief behind you.  
Before teleporting you can choose the state yourself or a non-living thing arrives when teleported and what will be its actions within 10 seconds. For example, you could teleport behind yourself with the state being that you are facing a new direction and the action being "walk as long as you can", you will continue walking until 10 seconds passes. Another example would be you having a switchblade on your pocket, then teleporting behind a person with your state being "facing the back of that person with my switchblade on my hand" and then action being "swing the hand with the switchblade".

Pyramid Head  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:Hatchetface  
Required:(Shaker/Stranger) The Mist of London Night  
Required:(Changer) Daymare  
Your powers have combined, granting you a form similar to the ever-elusive Pyramid Head. With this, all your physical abilities have gotten a substantial boost, which grows stronger the more fear you feast upon in your vicinity.  
Now, holding dominion over the fog permeating your entire being, constantly clad in a veil that obscures your presence and silhouette, its formless nature aiding in your hunt for prey, slipping away from the minds of all who gaze upon you once they lose sight even if for just a moment.  
You're not limited to just the fog clinging upon you either, able to push and expand its influence to cover an entire town, plunging everything trapped within in a deep haze of both mind and body, slowly draining the strength from their limbs and slowly eating away at the mind; manifesting as a constant gnawing at the back of the mind of those trapped inside.  
Parahumans who find themselves trapped within shall find their powers slowly weakening the longer they're inside the fog, to the point that they'll lose the ability to use their powers if trapped for long enough.  
The strength of these effects increases as the night progresses, peaking at the height of midnight, combined with fear felt by those trapped within.  
Your last ability is to form and shape the fog under you into any constructs you may so desire with the strength and durability of high-grade steel, able to grow stronger as more fear saturates the area that your fog is suffused in.

Lower Dantian  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:Chi Master  
Required:(Breaker/Trump) Energy Well  
Your energy well has synchronized with your chi, evolving it into an elixir field, or dantian. With this, all energy inside your energy well becomes chi, multiplying both its power and recharge rate by 10\. This does not remove any of the previous capabilities of your energy well, with anything you could do with the energy well now also being achievable using chi, with new possibilities such as regeneration now available to you.  
Your ability to absorb chi now spreads to the environment as well, allowing you to absorb the ambient chi of the natural world around you. Through this, you can increase the size and quality of your dantian, cultivating to higher levels of power.

Your ability to give chi is also enhanced, with your dantian allowing you to give even more chi than before. It still requires an entire person’s worth of chi to revive them. However, because your chi has been enhanced, they will no longer require daily doses of your chi to fully heal. They will instead be able to recover by themselves after that point, with the process being sped up by giving them more chi. If you have enough chi, it is possible to completely bring the recently deceased back to full health in a single moment.  
With this power, you could potentially cultivate to become strong enough to destroy the avatar of an entity. If you have Negentropy, your growth limit is removed, meaning that even the entity at its full power might be destroyed by you.  
*Martial Dao*  
Required:(Trump) Cultivation  
Your ability to cultivate anything has not only enhanced the speed at which you can grow your dantian but has also expanded your mind in the process.  
You gain the ability to cultivate a martial dao. With this, you can now optimize your chi to fit certain specializations. A sword dao would enhance your use of chi when using sword techniques, a fire dao would give you the ability to attack and heal with fire, etc.  
You are limited in scope to only 3 daos, with choosing a new one requiring you to abandon one of your current daos, losing all your progress with it and having to start anew. If you have negentropy, your knowledge of your previous daos is still retained when selecting new daos, but without powers that enhance learning or multitasking, you will only be able to make progress in three at the same time.  
*Middle Dantian*  
Required:(Trump) Arcanist  
Required:Archmage  
Your energy pool of magical energy has reacted to your dantian, becoming your middle dantian in the process. This will provide you with multiple benefits.  
First, this will allow you to use your spiritual and magical energies to either substitute or supplement each other for a variety of effects. However, substitution of chi with magic is slightly inefficient, with your spells becoming a bit weaker than if done regularly and vice versa. Supplementation, on the other hand, does not suffer from this problem, with spells instead becoming stronger than before, potentially doubling its power if enough chi is used. The same rules apply to your upper dantian if you have one, with your spells tripling in power if all are used.  
You gain the ability to absorb ambient magical energy and increase your middle dantian in both size and quality, just like your lower dantian. It is also possible to inject your chi from your lower dantian directly into the middle dantian, transforming it into magical energy in case there is no ambient magical energy. This process, however, requires precise control during the conversion and is not advised during the heat of battle.  
As a variation of your magical energy absorption, you can instead choose to absorb magical energy directly from other people. A normal person doesn’t have a lot of magic, but people with powers tend to have much more depending on how “magical” that power is. A person with the ability to blast fire from his hands will give you more power than someone who set fire with their mind. Take note that while absorbing all of someone’s magic may not kill them, it will still heavily weaken them and possibly put them in a coma.  
It is also possible to reverse this process and give magic to people, with the effect being like giving someone chi, but enhancing related powers alongside their health as it reacts to their chi.  
*Upper Dantian*  
Required:(Trump) Kineticist  
Required:Archmage  
Your psionic energy pool is now transformed into your upper dantian, giving you more options of what to do with it.  
It is now possible to substitute energy from one dantian to another and combine their energies to strengthen their effects. Your psionic techniques can use energy used from your other dantians instead of psionic energy at the cost of slightly weakening them. The same is true with using your upper dantian’s energy to substitute for another’s. Combining your psionic energy with the power of another dantian will instead result in your psionic techniques potentially doubling in strength, tripling if all of them are used and vice versa.  
You can also increase your upper dantians size and quality by absorbing ambient psionic energy. It is also possible to convert chi into psionic energy with time and effort, allowing you to cultivate in environments without abundant psionic energy. The same rules apply to other dantians as well, with one energy being transformed into another in case the different energies cannot be found.  
You can also absorb psionic energy directly from other people. People with thinker or other mind related powers will provide more psionic energy than other people. Take note, absorbing all of someone’s psionic energy won’t kill them but it will leave them in a coma, assuming they don’t have a power that lets them act without thinking. If they do have such a power, it will be automatically activated until they can properly recover said energy.

Lastly, you can give someone your psionic energy, enhancing their thinking and mind related powers directly, along with their health and other powers indirectly as it interacts with the energies inside them.  
*Martial Soul*  
Required:(Trump) Cultivation  
Required:(Trump) Arcanist  
Required:(Trump) Kineticist  
Required:Archmage  
Your mastery of cultivation has allowed you to break the barriers of common sense and combine the power within all three of your dantians. Your spiritual, magical, and psionic energies have all combined within you to form soul energy.

With soul energy, your martial daos, spells, and even your psionic techniques are all quadrupled in power. Substituting the use of one dantian for another no longer results in energy loss, as soul power is used in all of them. You may also effortlessly combine your different techniques into soul arts which are even stronger than your regular techniques due to being optimized for soul energy.  
Your dantians are all now linked to each other, meaning that cultivation one cultivates them all. This has the unfortunate side effect of slowing down your cultivation due to requiring each of the different energies to combine them into more soul energy, as a single energy only provides one fourth of the potential gains you would have obtained before. This can be circumvented, however, by directly absorbing soul energy from your environment. Ambient soul energy is generally rare, with soul energy typically being found within places where people worship, mourn, or have died in large quantities, with the objects used to carry out these activities also absorbing gaining some soul energy in the process.

It is possible to absorb soul energy directly from people, but this has the side effect of leaving them with a feeling of emptiness in their soul. This is assuming you don’t completely devour their soul.  
You can also give soul energy to people instead of ripping it out of them. This will not only revive the recently deceased back to full health but increase all of their powers four-fold before the energy is used up.  
Assuming you have Negentropy, you might be able to reach a level of power so high, you could fight an army of entities and live to tell the tale.

Accelerator, The One Way Road  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Striker) Vector Alteration  
Required:(Thinker) Number Man  
Inspired by the incredible Esper ability of Accelerator, your mathematical prowess and control over vectors have been combined into the overwhelming power known as Vector Manipulation. This power grants you the ability to create a thin field maintained by mathematical formulas around yourself, enabling you to manipulate vector values of anything near you.  
With this ability you can control various vectors, such as those related to kinetic energy, heat, electricity, and gravity. Initially limited to phenomena governed by physical laws known to humanity's laws of physics, your mathematical prowess allows you to incorporate vectors from unknown sources so long as you can analyze and adapt them into your equations, such as exotic matter, space-time distortions, parahuman powers, and potentially even phenomena unknown to the Entities like magic. As a result this adaptability may allow you to bend even the most foreign rules of reality to your advantage.  
Your (Thinker) Number Man power has been enhanced to the point of enabling you to do things like predict and dodge attacks effortlessly, foresee future actions, identify weak points in your opponents, precisely measure objects, leverage your strength flawlessly, sense your surroundings through subtle vibrations, and sense the internal vectors of things you touch while simultaneously using attacks and defenses which require complex calculations. These mental capabilities provide you with unparalleled strategic insight, making you a formidable force in any confrontation.

(Striker) Vector Alteration  
Cost: 10 SP  
With a touch you can change the direction of anything that touches you. It remains at the speed it was going prior to you touching it, only its direction has changed.

Higher Dimension  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Material  
Required:(Tinker) Meme  
Required:(Tinker) Information Hazard  
You can create higher-dimensional objects, such as Tesseracts. Due to human limitations, people will be unable to properly comprehend these objects. By staying around your creations, they will gain insight, allowing them to comprehend these objects at the cost of getting affected by various memetic hazards. These hazards can reach the point where they begin to warp both the minds and bodies of their targets, causing their target to "ascend", becoming a higher-dimensional object themselves. In theory, and with enough practice, your memetic hazards can even "infect" anything. You can also use this specialty to improve any other tinkertech you make, bestowing its unique properties to it. You can make yourself immune to the effects of your creations.  
*Multi Dimensional*  
Required:(Tinker) Interdimensional  
In addition to their higher-dimensional forms, your creations have also taken on a multidimensional form, allowing them to infect and alter reality in even more ways. They now have the potential to completely remake the laws of physics. This new level of control over the fabric of reality gives you the power to mold the universe in ways that were previously unthinkable, perhaps even incomprehensible to an ordinary man.

Iron Age  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Changer/Brute) T-1000  
Required:Cuff  
Required:Hookwolf  
Required: Kaiser, or Max Anders  
Your powers over metal have fused and your abilities are now far greater than the sum of its parts.  
You can easily manipulate all metals with incredible precision within a 4-kilometer radius of yourself. You can freely generate any type of metal or alloy by expelling it from any solid inorganic surface within your radius; using this ability you're capable of producing up to a hundred cubic metres of steel a second. You can construct metallic structures ranging from barriers and buildings to weapons, armour and equipment with the only limit to what you can build with metal being your imagination and understanding.  
Your control over metals allows you to shift any metal from solid to liquid states of matter (and vice versa) as you please while you telekinetically manipulate it. You are even able to alter the physical properties of the metals that you control to match that of other metals such as giving Silver the density of Tungsten although this effect will slowly fade if the metal leaves your radius.  
At a baseline, your natural physical condition has been enhanced to give you superhuman strength, speed and durability equivalent to the toughest Tungsten metal alloys. Alternatively, you can turn into a completely malleable metallic form containing a small marble sized core capable of withstanding a nuclear blast. This form grants you a 10-fold increase in strength and durability alongside a phenomenal level of regeneration that matches the speed at which you can generate metal.  
Finally, you possess a secondary Thinker ability which provides you with absolute awareness and comprehension of all metals within your range down to the size of a grain of sand as well as an unlimited capacity to multitask.  
Vibranium Core  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:Iron Age  
Required:(Striker) Vibranium  
Any and all metal you create/control is enhanced, permanently gaining the traits of Vibranium. In addition, you are able to temporarily turn any metal you touch into Adamantium, a metal that is virtually indestructible. You can choose to make it pure Adamantium or a Vibranium/Adamantium alloy. A blade of pure Adamantium is capable of cutting almost any non-exotic substance. After a week the Adamantium will return back to its state before its transformation.

Mental Healing  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Shaker/Master) Peace Zone  
Required:(Shaker) Healing Circle  
You possess the ability to heal more than just physical ailments; you can also mend minds afflicted by emotional, logical, improper healing, or genetic disorders, as well as those affected by master/strange/shaker effects or any other way a mind can be damaged/faulty.  
Your Healing Circle now extends to yourself, providing passive healing over time, with the option to increase its intensity through focus or decrease its radius or stop one way of healing (Physical or Mental).  
You have the effects of the Perk Well Adjusted at all times unless you take holding back and will impose its influence on others, even Shards if they are connected like Khepri/Fairy Queen, while the person is under effect, it will persist for a time after the target left the area, but will soon fade.  
The effect is not subtle with the person and the area of effect glowing.  
*Shell Shocked No More*  
Required: Chi Master, or Resurrection  
Through a loophole in the resurrection mechanism, Mental Healing effects are now permanently integrated into their very being, curing all mental and physical ailments indefinitely. This profound change means that any illnesses or psychological issues they had are resolved forever given enough time, even if the effects diminish when they are away from your presence with the Perk-like Well Adjusted being a constant on their lives now.  
*And one Enigma is Solved*  
Required: Esoteric Knowledge, or Shardless  
One of the most challenging aspects to address is a damaged soul, and this is evident even in the presence of your power. Your ability can mend, grow, and nurture souls, restoring them to their prime and beyond. This process provides proper rest and peace to this vital part of a being. When the flesh and mind deteriorate for no apparent reason, your power identifies the cause in the negative material possessed by living beings, fixing the issue and reinforcing that point of failure.  
For beings made entirely of negative materials, your power makes them more "real" by stabilizing their existence. This transformative effect corrects the inherent instability caused by their composition, solidifying their presence and reducing their ethereal or volatile nature. The result is a more resilient, balanced, and harmonious spiritually existence.  
By addressing the soul's well-being, your power not only heals but also strengthens, ensuring that the mended soul can withstand future challenges.

The Taught  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Polymath  
Required: Teacher, or Teacher  
You can grant another person a thinker/tinker power or a wide range of skills. While you can only imbue a single thinker/tinker power (or three with negentropy) per person, you can imbue up to seven (or ten with negentropy) skills. Bestowing more skills or a more potent thinker/tinker power strengthens the loyalty the target has for you, with them becoming completely fanatical to you at the highest level. Note that while this is the case, they can still function and are able to think for themselves, as long as what they are thinking about isn't related to you.  
The duration of your boosts, however, is inversely proportional to their strength — the more potent the thinker/tinker power or the more skills granted, the shorter its duration, lasting up to a year at most and a week at least.  
*Student, now the Master*  
Required:Sharing is Caring  
You can grant a person a single skill permanently, although after they gain said skill, they must wait a month before they are able to gain another skill. Even without that, they can quickly learn any skill they have been granted, as portions of it will remain even after it is lost. Additionally, the effects of your powers last longer, now all lasting at least a month before they fade away.  
*Learning More*  
Required:(Tinker/Trump) Assistant  
Required:Über  
The number of skills and thinker/tinker powers you can grant increases the more they have been under the effects of your power. For someone who has been under the effects of your power for over a year, they would be able to have 10 skills and 3 thinker/tinker powers (20 skills and 7 thinker/tinker powers with negentropy).

Atropos Wannabe  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:The Old  
Required:(Thinker) Omniscient  
Don't fancy a battle? Need something eliminated? Planning a massacre? Now, the question isn't whether it can be killed, but rather, how brutally and stylishly you want it done. You possess the power to kill anything, whether it's a person, a machine, or even abstract concepts like 'this conversation,' 'his reputation,' or 'her bank account'. If something can be terminated in any conceivable way, you have the knowledge and capability to execute it flawlessly automatically. Should you choose to hold back your lethal abilities during a confrontation, you can 'pull your punches' with deliberate intent and when it comes to caring or showing concern you can 'give zero fucks' about anything whether in whole or in part.

Techno-Magica?  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Electronics  
Required: Ki (Dragon Ball Series), Chakra (Naruto), Sendo (JJBA), or (Striker/Trump/Thinker) Chi Blocking  
You now possess the ability to perceive pseudo-spiritual energy as it flows through electronic devices. By channeling this energy through your hands, you can apply various effects to it. These effects include deactivating it, crashing it, inducing a sleep-like state, freezing its operation, or causing it to lose concept of time. Such altered states are challenging to reverse without the use of pseudo-spiritual energy, making settings where they "don't exist" nearly impervious to disruption.  
Yes, Techno-Magica.  
Cost: 11 SP  
Required:Techno-Magica?  
Required:Chi Master  
Required:(Tinker) Energy  
You have discovered how to go beyond simply interfering with electronics using spiritual energy. For you see, spiritual energy is still energy, and you are an energy tinker. Everything you could do with electricity can now also be done with chi and other spiritual energies. From chi batteries, spiritual wiring, to even gasoline powered chi generators, you can do it all.  
This even synergizes with your other tinker powers, allowing you to use spiritual power in your tinkertech. You could make prosthetics powered by the user’s own spiritual energy, chi powered weaponry, or just use it to upgrade your computer.

Even your other esoteric energies are not safe from your revelation. With the boundaries on what your power considers energy broken, it becomes possible to analyze these energies and also integrate them into tinkertech. This has a side effect of optimizing your usage of any powers that seem to absorb or interact with said energies.  
If you have esoteric knowledge, then even good old-fashioned magic will simply become science you don’t understand, yet.

Power Guru  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Trump) Boosted  
Required:Permanent Change  
Required:Controlled Tweaking  
You can jailbreak powers. Doing so lets you free up other people's abilities by taking off their limitations or unlocking new capabilities, but there are some limits. First, you can't change the core concept of the power, so a person with pyrokinesis won't suddenly become a chrono kinetic. You can give power properties of another power by being in contact with two capes at once. Second, the more changes you make, the longer it will take before you can do it again. The longest you'll have to wait between jailbreaking someone is a month. Each person you work with has their own cooldown period, so there's no need to wait to help others. Lastly, each change can only increase the power's cost by 15 SP or double its original cost, whichever is less. You can still give side-grades to powers without cooldown.  
*Exponential Power*  
Required:(Trump) Growth Booster  
Your powers fuse with one another, merging seamlessly and gaining each other's features.  
You’ve become far more flexible and precise in how much you can alter powers. You can now rewrite a power entirely, from its most core concepts to its more nuanced applications.  
When making a change to a power, you can now opt to choose to do a single immediate change, or to apply a growth booster.  
A power no longer has any limit to how many times Growth Booster may be applied to it, although they cannot be held on the same power concurrently.  
Applying a Growth Booster will trigger the month-long cool down, although rewrites and alterations of a power, including adding side grades, may be done as normal. Power Guru upgrade may be applied as normal once the cool down is completed, even if the Growth Booster is still in place.  
Power Guru’s cool down is now applied to individual powers, rather than individual parahumans.  
Power Guru can now also be applied to yourself and any power you possess, although you're still subject to the limitations and rules of Power Guru.  
(Trump) Boosted  
Cost: 6 SP  
You can permanently boost the powers of any Parahuman based on a certain amount of charges you use. You gain a charge every 24 hours which can be imbued into any Parahuman. Every time you boost a Parahuman, the strength they gain gets weaker the more you do it. Boosts will completely stop once they reach 200% power. This can be used to recharge Eidolon. To fully boost someone to 200% power requires 6 months.  
(Trump) Scramble  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can swap the expression of powers to any Parahuman for an hour. They will possess the same Shard but have an alternate version of what they could be. Shaker power can be turned into a Striker power.  
Controlled Tweaking  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Trump) Scramble  
You can now completely control how the affected powers express themselves. This allows you to change powers horizontally at will, though they cannot change in overall strength or versatility.  
Permanent Change  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Trump) Scramble  
All changes to powers via Scramble are permanent.

The Living Force  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Brute/Mover) Alexandria  
Required:(Striker/Shaker) Tyrant  
Required:(Brute) Unstoppable Force  
Your main ability centers around the manipulation of forces acting upon or originating from your own body, and it operates with next to no upper limit. This means you can output forces equivalent to several megatons worth of TNT with nothing but a casual flick of your wrist, reach absurd levels of superluminal speeds during flight, and endure the entirety of the world's nuclear arsenals ten times over without sustaining a scratch. Your strength reaches staggering levels, allowing you to move celestial bodies with raw strength alone or reshape continents with little to no effort.  
As your power isn't dependent on your muscles or any physical component, you can lift things and people without worrying about structural integrity or their safety as your field protects them and the environment from any adverse effects caused by you if you don't want them harmed.  
When it comes to defense, you have two options: you can either neutralize incoming forces, rendering bullets harmless as they cascade harmlessly around your feet, or redirect these energies back towards their source, causing projectiles to ricochet and fists to shatter against your unyielding chest. When not consciously controlling the vectors of your power, you inadvertently nullify the full spectrum of forces your abilities can harness, dramatically weakening cosmic forces to the point where the epicenter of a black hole pulls no harder than a gentle breeze, the searing heat of a star's core registers as mild discomfort, and standing at the epicenter of a supernova merely tousles your hair.  
Your sensory abilities are elevated to unparalleled levels of extremity. You possess the power to fine-tune your hearing, enabling you to decipher conversations spanning entire planets. Your vision allows you to discern intricate details of distant alien worlds simply by gazing into the night sky. You can even perceive the intricate dance of strings and quantum particles held within the palm of your hand.  
Your movements are executed with subatomic precision, allowing you to snatch bullets from the air effortlessly or effortlessly outmatch even the most skilled hand-to-hand combatants at their own game. You have transcended the need for any form of sustenance, whether it be the physical requirements like air, nourishment, water, or sleep, or more abstract psychological ones.

Debt  
Cost: 16 SP  
Required:(Master) Geas  
Required:(Stranger/Trump) Exchange Broker  
Whenever you make a deal with someone, regardless of whether or not they know about your abilities, an invisible contract is formed. If the other party does not uphold their end of the Deal, you have the power to take anything from them, but the severity of what can be taken is limited based on the severity of the breach. The longer they owe you something, the more you can take from them as interest.

Solarpunk: "I SPEAK FOR THE TREES\!\!"  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Lorax  
Required:(Tinker/Thinker) Solarpunk  
The potential of Solarpunk and the arboreal knowledge of Lorax, have fused into this. While Solarpunk still allows you to fuse nature and technology, you have a far greater depth when it comes to focusing on trees and their produce. Large towering trees that could hold large towns and even small cities, these trees so tough they could survive an Endbringer assault.  
Your Chlorakinetic power is also enhanced from a touch-based power to a ranged power of at least 20m, to the point where you can implement your tinker designs into plants as long as the said plant is a variant of a tree. Oak electrical generators, Birchwood supercomputing center, Weeping Willows with kinetic branches to beat people to death, and yes you can even create spaceships with trees. Have Fun\!  
Solarpunk: Esoterica  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Trump/Master) Magical Plant  
Required:(Tinker/Thinker) Solarpunk  
Solarpunk and Magical Plants have combined into something new. When creating plant-based components, you will be able to connect them to shards and grant them powers. Based on the power that manifests, the component it is made from will be able to utilize it in some way. A plant-based computer core with temporal powers could get highly accurate data from the future or past, a power core for a generator with the power of heat absorption allowing it to power itself from the surrounding temperature, or even an empowered repair component that causes a device to regenerate damage taken.  
You also understand how to automate these components and treat them like pieces of technology, programming them how you'd like.  
Finally, your psychic link is upgraded to a form of technopathy. But this will only work if said technology has a component you made within it, the longer the component resides within the device the more control over its functions you will obtain.

Reality Hacker  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Code  
Required: (Tinker) Space, or (Tinker) Nuclear  
Your specialization extends to include quantum and particle physics. With it you can create computers and programs that alter the world around them. The more powerful the effect the more powerful the computer needs to be. Basically letting you create Shaker/Stranger effects.

Theoretical Communications  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Communication  
Required: (Tinker) Quantum Computing, or (Tinker) Software  
You are capable of receiving messages from the future. Since computer science is nothing but messages, this means that data itself is spread across time. To decode and interpret these future messages effectively, you will need immense processing power in case of (Tinker) Quantum Computing, or a vast decentralized network using (Tinker) Software. In the case of using both, a small 15 meters square of computing to relay and decode complex messages is fine.

(Un)Holy Trinity  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Cybernetics  
Required: (Tinker) Self-Alteration, Bonesaw, or Riley Grace Davis  
Your improvement/augmentation focus in the physical, the mental and the spiritual alike.

Shard-Like  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Software  
Required:(Tinker) Quantum Computing  
You can program more than computers. You can code brains, and even shards. However, you need specialized equipment in order to do this. You can create programs that analyze and draw conclusions, creating programs with Thinker powers. This even allows for limited precognitive abilities using incredibly complex analysis programs. Requires extensive data input and processing power to work, however.

Turing-Machine  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Electronics  
Required:(Tinker) Chemistry  
You are not limited to electronics, managing to create wetware, gooware, molecular, Optical/Spintronics or even Stochastic computers and more.

Werewolf  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Striker/Changer) Wolf Time  
Required: Rachel Lindt, or Bitch  
You gain and can grant anyone a permanent changer ability. When used on a human, they can change into a canine, as well as a hybrid between a canine and a human. If used on a canine, their intelligence is boosted; they gain a human form and a hybrid form that mixes their canine features with their human ones. The hybrid form boasts enhanced strength, durability, agility, and an asymmetrical covering of bony plates, spikes, exposed muscles, calcified flesh, and prehensile tails. Even in their base form they will have increased strength, regeneration and senses.  
*Fenrir’s Chosen*  
Required:Hound Of Hell  
When used on a parahuman, their transformations will reflect their abilities. Upon activating their hybrid form, they will receive a boost to their main power, doubling the SP cost, and gain numerous secondary abilities. The total SP cost of all secondary powers will be the same as the original SP cost of the parahuman's main power.  
Beast Time  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:(Striker/Changer) Wolf Time  
Required:(Changer/Brute) Dinosaur  
You can turn yourself and others into any non-supernatural animal from any planet you've been to. When transformed, you and your targets will gain subconscious behavior or whatever animal you transform them into.  
*Were-Beast*  
Required:Werewolf  
You can now grant a hybrid form for any animal, and can be used on any animal. You could give a human a hybrid bear form, or grant a cat a hybrid human form. You can even give a fish a hybrid snake form if you felt like it instead.  
*Beast of Hell*  
Required:Werewolf  
Required:Hound Of Hell  
You can now empower any non-supernatural animal from any planet you've been to, creating a personalised transformation that further boosts their abilities.

Taskmaster  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Comprehension  
Required:(Thinker) Polymath  
You can now choose to instantly learn any skill you wish, provided you’d be able to learn, use, and understand it otherwise. You can utilize this for example to master Karate but won’t be able to master Earthbending, unless you possess the ability to Earthbend on your own. Any skills that would require muscle memory will be granted through this, and any skill or muscle memory that you need to forget and revert for any reason can be done so at will.  
[Comprehension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.w4r3pe6ks1gv)  
(Thinker) Polymath  
Cost: 15 SP  
You have 7 slots (10 with negentropy) which can either be filled with a skill or a Thinker power.  
When you slot in a skill, you can use it at the highest possible level. These skills include the mastery of a single style of martial arts, a field of medicine or science, cooking, juggling, and more. Anything that can be learned you can have. Skills that require muscle memory provide it.  
The Thinker powers you can have are limited to at most a rating of 5 on the PRT scale. Powers that operate on your senses and observations will tend to be more accurate than those that require external information (like precognition).

Realistic Army  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Striker/Trump) Idol Theory  
Required:(Master) Golem  
You can now extend the effects of (Striker/Trump) Idol Theory into any golem you animate. Not only that, when animating statues that resemble people, these statues will gain the memories/skills/powers of these people. The Golems will still be loyal to you.

Timeless  
Cost: 16 SP  
Required:Epoch  
Required:Undo-Redo  
You can freely move through time. You are capable of rewinding, pushing forward, or pausing time. You can use this power to move yourself or others to where they were at any moment, move things to where they're slated to be at any moment in the future, or pause things for no limits, releasing at a whim.  
Epoch  
Cost: 6 SP  
You can move things to where they were ten seconds ago, move things to where they're slated to be ten seconds in the future, or pause things for up to ten seconds, releasing at a whim.  
[Undo-Redo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.bz98atbiq8wf)

Great Old One  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Sealed King  
Required:(Breaker/Master) Eldritch  
You have been released, your form true. You can do more than merely change information about yourself, you can change those who have such information. Any being who holds knowledge of you can be affected, their bodies and minds twisting and changing into forms that befit their roles as your eternal servants. The more knowledge they have, the bigger the changes possible. They can gain special powers and capabilities from their new forms, and they will also gain a weaker version of (Trump/Thinker) Who Do You Think I Am?, as they will gain minor powers, skills, and a false appearance based on what others think of them. They will be incapable of controlling this aspect of their power, and they will gain a mix of powers and forms based on what various groups think of them. They will also gain the “Odd” drawback.  
Sealed King  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Trump/Thinker) Who Do You Think I Am?  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Memetic King  
You possess the ability to modify information about yourself, and the degree to which you can alter it varies with the number of people who have knowledge of you. If only a few people are aware of you, you can only alter the information of your name. Once you attain a continental level of familiarity from people, you can transform any aspect of your identity, including your abilities and appearance. Physical and Mental information is affected by this power, so even written documents will have been changed.  
Memetic Me  
Cost: 17 SP  
Required:(Trump/Thinker) Who Do You Think I Am?  
You can now become strong enough to destroy the planet and more. However, to reach such a level in strength you need at least a continent's worth of people to strongly believe that you have such a level of strength.  
(Trump/Thinker) Who Do You Think I Am?  
Cost: 23 SP  
You will have the powers, skills, and abilities people of a certain collective think you have. For instance, if you choose the PRT you will have all the abilities, powers, and skills that they think you possess. The more people in a collective the more stable this power is. And over a certain amount, the powers gained are much stronger than what anyone thinks. If the majority of the global population thinks you have something, you possess that power permanently. However, you cannot become strong enough to destroy the planet. But if they think you can move the stars, you'll be able to gain a power that lets it seem like you can.  
You can swap between which collective you are currently gaining powers from, but it takes a couple of minutes. The more a collective disagrees with what you possess, the more unreliable and weaker it is.  
[You Can’t Kill An Idea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.9t2r5xpmsuof) (Memetic King)

Saitama's Will  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Brute) Unstoppable Force  
Required:(Brute) Immovable Object  
Required:(Brute) Unlimited Potential  
You have the ability to increase your physical power through the use of daily exercise. The increase is exponential, and continuously performing a set routine will increase the effect. However, if a day of exercise is missed, the rate of growth is reset to its base. The rate of growth scales based on your current stats. By performing 100 pushups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, and a 10 km run, without using air conditioning or consuming anything but a banana for breakfast for 3 years, the user will gain immense physical strength and power. This is the minimum amount of exercise for it to be counted. After a maximum of 3 years of continuous exercise, your sneeze alone can blow away all gas on Jupiter.

Lich  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Brute) Zombie  
Required:(Master) Undead  
Your power to control undead has evolved, and your mastery over it has grown significantly.  
You now start off with 150 points (300 with Negentropy) and receive an additional 10 points (20 with Negentropy) every month.  
You gain a minor tinker power, specialising on corpses. You can fuse your undead, creating powerful frankenstein monsters. If the need arises, you can absorb your undead, fusing with them by grafting their dead bodies to your own. If you fuse with corpses of a parahuman, you can gain access to their power, although limited to that particular part.  
For example, by fusing with Shadow Stalker’s arm, you can make said arm enter her Shadow State, but the rest of your body will be unable to do the same. Fusing with an undead makes them no longer cost any point to maintain.  
*Wraith*  
Required:(Thinker) Ghostmates  
You can use your points to turn any ghost you summoned into a wraith. Wraiths can fly at a low altitude and transition between intangible and tangible states at will. They retain any power they had in life. They have autonomy but are instinctively loyal to you.  
If taken with Possessed, they are also able to possess others and use their powers through them. If they possess their reanimated corpse, their power is greatly boosted.  
(Master) Undead  
Cost: 20 SP  
You are capable of reviving deceased individuals and returning them to life. They will all have the (Brute) Zombie power. The longer a subject has been deceased before resurrection, the less memories and mannerisms they will retain.  
Zombies are free to act independently, though those who have been dead for longer will display less independent thought. The power of a revived individual will affect the amount of points required to control them. You start off with 100 points (150 with Negentropy).  
A zombie of an ordinary human will take up one point, while a zombie of a parahuman with a power equivalent to T1 will take up 5 points, a zombie of a parahuman with a power equivalent to T2 will take up 20 points, and a zombie of a parahuman with a power equivalent to T3 will take up 60 points. Finally, zombies of ordinary animals will take up less than two points, depending on the abilities of the animal.  
(Brute) Zombie  
Cost: 7 SP  
You possess extraordinary resilience, enabling you to endure severe injuries and remain alive even if your body is severely damaged, as long as your corona potentia remains undamaged. Should any other part of the brain endure damage, you may experience a loss of bodily functions. Your regenerative capability is limited, requiring weeks to heal major wounds or lost limbs. You will also lose the need for sleep, food, and water. Your body will resemble a well-preserved corpse, as you will have no heartbeat, no need to breathe, and a low body temperature.  
*The Living Dead*  
Required:Ghoul  
If you have a corona, it has become spread out across your body with redundancies. If you don't have a corona, then your consciousness is spread out across you in the same way. Even if you are reduced to a pile of meat, as long as there's a clump of stuff left over, you will survive. But that's not the true power of this mutation.  
Firstly, your severed parts no longer lose connection when they're gone. Instead, when you lose any part of your body, be it a limb, organ, blood or even skin cells, it begins to regenerate and grow at a slow but steady pace, eventually creating a copy of the body you had when it was lost. In order to create a full copy the lost piece needs at least 30% of your mass, which it can gain by fusing with nearby pieces. It takes weeks for these copies to fully grow, with diminishing returns with higher levels of regeneration. You control these other bodies like you control your own limbs and can move your core consciousness between them at will. Clone bodies you are not currently housed in will rot at an accelerated pace, scaling with regeneration, to deteriorate and become useless in a minimum of twenty-eight days.

Clone Absorber  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Master) Cloning  
Required:(Changer/Striker) Amalgam  
You can now clone any biological lifeform, no longer limited to parahumans. During the cloning process, you can absorb the clone's abilities, knowledge, and skills, adding them to your own. This allows you to have a wide variety of powers at your disposal, which can be used in a variety of ways. The absorbed powers will slowly decay with use and will be lost after multiple uses. Any passive powers you may gain can be deactivated at will. Additionally, the absorbed powers can be combined to create new abilities, giving you an almost unlimited number of ways to use your powers. Finally, you also gain the ability to transform your body, adding traits from creatures you absorb.  
You can regain the use of lost powers by transforming your body and adding the traits of their original owners. For example, transforming your arm into Alexandria’s arm will allow you to regain access to her power; however, the power will be limited to only Alexandria's arm and will not spread to the rest of the body.  
[(Master) Cloning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.vq1s2sd6whgd)

Isekai  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Thinker/Trump) Kingmaker  
Required:(Mover/Thinker) Ideal Transit  
Required:(Thinker) Vision  
With a touch you can transport people into alternate realities, sending them on an adventure tailor made with their strengths and weaknesses in mind. Once the adventure is complete, they will return to where they were originally, with no more than a few seconds having passed.  
You possess the power to transport individuals to alternate realities, crafting personalized adventures that cater to their strengths and weaknesses. Time inside the alternate reality may pass differently, the entire experience will only last a few seconds in their original reality, and they will return to the same place once their adventures has concluded. Additionally, they will retain all the knowledge and abilities they acquire during their adventures. They cannot gain Shardless powers unless you have esoteric knowledge. You can use this power on yourself, but it is recommended to give yourself at least a week long break after each adventure.  
*Planned Trip*  
Required:Homecoming  
You can now choose the world you send people to and/or set specific parameters/filters for it, as specific or broad as you want, or choose for it to remain under your power’s discretion as normal.

For example, this allows you to send people to any of the Worlds shown in the Alternate Earth section, including any potential AU modifiers, for their Isekai Journey including yourself.  
Your power will build a catalog of worlds and filters you’ve used in the past for ease of use in the future. This comes prefilled with each of the settings and AU modifiers, different world modifiers, etc in this CYOA.  
*Create Your Own Adventure*  
Required:Character Creation  
You can now go incredibly in-depth with creating the character.  
You can choose abilities, choose their backgrounds, their reincarnations, the settings they go to, etc.  
You have a set pool of power that you can choose to shape their abilities. This pool can be used to create unique abilities suited to the affected targets, grant them skills, items, or even perks.  
Likewise you can also establish drawbacks, negative effects that either affect the user, such as strange unavoidable impulses, or the world, such as inserting monstrous beings or apocalyptic events into the setting whereas they otherwise wouldn’t have been, or even simply ensuring they’ll have significant hurdles to overcome such as enemies.  
The pool of power can be increased by sending the target to more dangerous worlds or establishing drawbacks, the more dangerous the world and/or drawbacks, the greater the pool grows.  
The size of the pool equals to the amount of power you can imbue a sensory with on a world similar in danger to Earth Aleph as a starting reference.  
Now if you use a medium, you are no longer limited to your own strength, but if you surpass your 1/10 limit then the target's success is no longer guaranteed. You can now send as many sensory as you can normally produce, sending the target directly does not count towards your sensory limit.

Paradigm  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:(Trump) Paramount  
Required:Higher Priest  
Paramount and Eidolon have merged, becoming something greater than the sum of their parts, and granting you unparalleled versatility. With this upgrade, you can choose up to two Tier 3 powers, three Tier 2 powers, or five Tier 1 powers. You can now directly choose which powers to get through a catalog in your mind, these powers are instantly accessible and come with an innate understanding of how to use them effectively.  
What sets Paradigm apart is its power growth and adaptation. As you use your abilities, they continuously evolve and become more powerful, adapting to different situations. These enhancements are permanent, allowing you to constantly improve and refine your powers over time.  
Additionally, the Paradigm upgrade provides a unique advantage by making you a precognitive blind spot. This means that no one, including the entity, can predict your actions or intentions. This ability grants you exceptional strategic planning capabilities and allows for surprise attacks.  
Note: If you also possess Negentropy, the speed at which your powers grow and adapt increases threefold. Furthermore, it expands the number of powers you can possess to three Tier 3, five Tier 2, or eight Tier 1 powers.  
*Kaleidoscope Fractal Core*  
Required:Engine of Escalation  
Through the fusion of Engine of Escalation and Paradigm, your shard has mutated into the Kaleidoscope Fractal Core, allowing it to brute force access to the vast Data catalogs of The Warrior, The Thinker, The Wanderer, and even the esoteric Data of Shardless. This seamless integration removes the constraints of power tiers.  
Initially, your maximum powers are limited to the equivalent of Greater Keystones, but with time, this will progressively expand in scope. When confronted with challenges lacking immediate solutions, your powers instinctively provide the most appropriate options available. Moreover, the number of power slots will gradually increase over time, further enhancing your versatility.  
Furthermore, the Kaleidoscope Fractal Core continually scans your surroundings, gathering and generating new Data. This constantly evolves your catalog and ensures that it constantly adapts, refines, and refashions itself to meet your ever-changing needs and challenges.  
*The Endbringer*  
Required:(Changer) The End-Becomer  
Required:Engine of Escalation  
Required:(Master) Bringer of the End  
You are not an Endbringer, you are The Endbringer. Your powers are enhanced massively, growing by an order of magnitude, and you now possess all your powers in either form.  
Your Endbringer powers are now instead additional slots for Paradigm. But most importantly your form is now malleable just like your power set, you are now able to change forms with a moment’s concentration.  
You’ve now also gained command of all existing Endbingers and each Endbringer has been given the perks False Corona Pollentia, Pocket Shard, and Negentropy and may also grant them the ability to take a human form. You may also grant them lesser copies of any perks you possess.  
You can also create more Endbringers if you’d like and may freely modify any already created. You may gift any Endbringer any power/perk you possess.  
*Harmonic Engine*  
Required:Engine of Escalation  
Required:(Breaker/Trump) Ignis Fatuus  
Required:(Trump) Aliena  
Your power has evolved, removing the limitations of the number of slots and focusing on available power. You can now break down or fuse your slots in any combination, from adding them all together or breaking them down to the cost of a T0 power.  
Your slots automatically adjust to optimize energy usage. Alongside Paradigm's normal passive power creation, you can instantly construct and add powers to your library, as long as your slots have sufficient power, as well as freely modify powers in your possession.  
You can modify powers in your possession by cycling through different expressions, boosting one aspect at the expense of another, changing its restrictions, altering its interactions with other powers, or modifying its mechanics entirely.  
Your flickering ability is greatly enhanced, removing its prior restrictions and extending to the largest range among your powers or 100 meters, whichever is greater. You can expand your library of powers and freely modify any of your powers through flickering, with the process becoming intuitive and effortless.  
Powers you wield through Paradigm have much greater synergy than they would otherwise, producing far greater results when used in conjunction than they would normally.  
Your normal slots are increased by half (doubled if you have Shardless/Negentropy). You also possess a secondary thinker ability to effortlessly manage and reconfigure your slots.  
*Criteria Benefactor*  
Required:Endless Reflection  
Required:(Striker/Trump) Perk  
Required:(Thinker) Polymath  
Your knowledge repository and Perk/Drawback provider have consolidated within Paradigm, allowing the creation of a standalone set of slots numbering in 7, where you allocate a particular Skill, Perk, or Drawback to either use yourself or share with a companion, teammate or enemy. Your mental catalog broadens to additionally include a comprehensive list of every possible Skill, Perk or Drawback; except for Negentropy, Esoteric Knowledge, and anything that specifically requires either of the two unless you have them. The sharing restrictions are still dependent on it needing to make sense to be bestowed to anyone.  
These Skills, Perks, or Drawbacks are accessed through Endless Reflections, compiled, and then (wishfully) mutated, not unlike Skill Up, as a result of reaching out to Paradigm’s Catalog then synthesizing it with Polymath and/or Perk’s repository, but achieving the same result with more overt paranatural traits, such as glaring physical enhancements to support it in the case of Skills. All of the Skills, Perks, and Drawbacks are also susceptible to Paradigm’s adaptive growth.  
With Kaleidoscope, the scope and scale of Skills, Perks or Drawbacks extend to those yet to come or never meant to be, applying the same process of scouring and adaptation to them.  
With Harmonic Engine, your Skills/Perks/Drawbacks are now free-form, malleable on their construction and modification, and able to be fused with any other power, skill, and what have you, while also being just as synergistic with any slot. The sharing process is more flexible, using your flickering to impart any Skill/Perk/Drawback.

Araboth  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Celestial Artificer  
Required:(Trump) Prototype  
You’ve started to walk the path of self-improvement and enlightenment, enhancing and enchanting your body and items alike. Prototype subsumes Celestial Artificer, gaining the ability to enhance yourself, expanding your overall power, and granting enchantments to yourself. Your starting point is Grey.  
Your powers meld together flawlessly, allowing you the capability to swap out Enchantments and Powers on both yourself and items you’ve enhanced, you have no restrictions on the kind of powers and enchantments you can make. The sum of their parts are greatly enhanced as well in comparison to their components. Legendary and Mythic enchantments no longer require more than 1 charge and you can spend additional charges to further amplify and tweak existing abilities.

Upon reaching Mythical level, you can spend the equivalent amount of charges it would take getting from Grey to White, to once again magnify your potency by the same degree it would the first time as well as granting you the same amount of additional slots to store powers. You can follow this until you once again reach Mythical level, letting you restart the process. This applies to both objects and powers. You can freely swap whatever you have stored in your items with your own collection and vice versa.  
You produce 10 charges a day (15 with Shardless/Negentropy), and the amount of slots you gain with each level stays the same, however, level Grey instead starts with 6 active slots instead of 1\. They also always have twice as many inactive slots to store other enchantments/powers that they can instantly swap out. You can take back/reallocate your charges at any time. Shardless/Negentropy increases the initial starting slots to 8 and inactive slots will be thrice as many active slots.  
*Archmage’s Workshop*  
Required:Archmage  
Required:(Trump/Tinker) Artificer  
Your “arcane” grandmaster powers merge together. The amount of charges you produce a day increases by 20 (30 with Shardless/Negentropy), and each level grants five times as many slots. You require half as many charges to level up. Charges don’t have diminishing returns.  
*Sigillum Dei*  
Required:Paradigm  
Araboth and Paradigm merge and coalesce into one ability. The amount of charges is cut down to half however each charge has crystallized into something greater, roughly thrice as powerful as before. Once you reach the Mythical level the amount and potency of charges you produce will double, and continue to do so every time you reach it again.  
You lose the extra starting slots granted by Araboth and no longer have inactive slots. In exchange, the distinction between an Araboth slot and Paradigm slot disappears; each becomes capable of using the powers and enchantments their component powers could produce, and will mutate and adapt as Paradigm normally does. This also applies to the base power as well. Paradigm will be able to contain more powerful abilities as you make your way through the upper levels, similar to enchantments.  
The enchantment process takes a more flexible approach, allowing you to not only generate new abilities on the fly but rapidly advance them by pouring more charges into them.  
*Arakiel*  
Required:(Trump) Manager  
Araboth subsumes Manager, adding its capabilities to itself and mutating new ones. Manager’s slots are added to Araboth.  
Powers copied or stolen by Manager can now be added to your slots, and you can manipulate powers enchantments as you would before. This also copies the power’s pattern for yourself as well for later recreation.  
However the biggest change is you can now enhance and enchant other people the same way you would yourself or items.  
Celestial Artificer  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required: Dauntless, or Shawn  
Required:(Trump/Tinker) Enhancer  
You have become the Celestial Artificer, gaining the ability to enhance items through two primary functions: Upgrading and Enchanting. Upgrading allows the wielder to elevate an item's rarity, which determines its level of power and quality. The rarity levels are as follows:  
\* Trash (Gray) \- These are mundane items without any effects, akin to common everyday objects like rocks or kitchen knives. They can hold a single enchantment.  
\* Common (White) \- Representing Items with weak effects. Possess 2 enchantment slots and costing 3 charges to raise from Trash.  
\* Uncommon (Green) \- Moving up the ranks, Uncommon items possess 3 enchantment slots, and a Mundane rarity can be upgraded to this level with 7 charges.  
\* Rare (Blue) \- With 5 enchantment slots, their potential for unique effects is expanded, and they can be upgraded from Uncommon with 13 charges.  
\* Epic (Purple) \- Powerful Items with 7 enchantment slots, and requiring 19 charges to upgrade from Rare.  
\* Exotic (Yellow) \- Minor Artifacts possessing 9 enchantment slots, and requiring 25 charges to upgrade from Epic.  
\* Unique (Red) \- Representing Grand Artifacts, Unique items have 12 enchantment slots and need 32 charges to upgrade from Exotic.  
\* Legendary (Orange) \- The penultimate items of this grade possess 15 enchantment slots and can be upgraded from Unique with 40 charges.  
\* Mythical (Black) \- The pinnacle, these are Divine Artifacts, with 20 enchantment slots, and are immensely potent, requiring 50 charges to upgrade from Legendary.

The second function, Enchanting, involves applying anomalous effects to items. Every enchantment costs a single "Charge," and the wielder gains three Charges every day. The only limits of enchantments is the wielder's creativity, from enhancing a blade's sharpness to imbuing healing aura or curses onto an item, with higher rarity grades unlocking access to more powerful and unique enchantments. Mythical and Legendary enchantments may require more than one Charge to be applied.

Health Network  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Brute) No, I am Spartacus  
Required:(Brute) No, I am Leonidas  
Every living being that you are actively aware of is part of a Health Network, where damage may be redistributed to anyone else in the network at your wish. If you cannot react fast enough, damage will automatically redistribute according to a priority system that you control.  
(Brute) No, I am Leonidas  
Cost: 3 SP  
You absorb all the damage done to every ally within 10 meters of you before they can even notice it, causing them no damage or pain. You may selectively choose what damage to take. This does not provide any other standard brute perks, so take with caution.  
(Brute) No, I am Spartacus  
Cost: 3 SP  
Any damage done to you will be spread evenly among any living being larger than a large rat within 10 meters of you. A bullet to the head will probably still kill you, even if there are 10 other people within range of you. It will also just kill all of them.

Optimal Choice  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Schrodinger  
Required:(Thinker) Glimpse  
You can choose to see an unlimited amount of visions, but at the cost of them being ten seconds long. You can also use this ability within other precognitive visions, including Schrodinger. You are able to subconsciously filter these visions into specific scenarios so that they don't overload your mind.  
5 Coiling Serpents  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Schrodinger  
Required: Coil, or Thomas Calvert  
Your five visions can last indefinitely, although if you choose one of the visions the other 4 must be dropped.  
*Limitless Paths*  
Required:Optimal Choice  
Instead of 10 seconds, each of your visions can last at least 5 minutes.  
Nidhogg  
Required:Thinker (Multitask)  
You can now pause and choose from a number of select futures, the number of futures and the length of those futures are inversely proportional. You can see and choose either from five futures, each lasting indefinitely, all the way up to a hundred futures, each up to a day long. You do not have to select a future to see it.  
Paradoxical  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:5 Coiling Serpents  
Required:(Master) Paradox  
Your clones can now last indefinitely, however will be far more vulnerable to the effects of time, aging faster and being erased instantly if under the effect of any time based power (such as Clockblocker).  
Copenhagen Interpretation  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required: Coil, Thomas Calvert, (Thinker) Schrodinger, or (Thinker) Vision  
Not only can you simulate timelines, but now you can make a binary choice. From that point on, two realities exist in a state of quantum superposition, diverging from the point of that choice and lasting until one possibility is dropped. Like superposition, once one 'reality' is chosen, the two realities resolve like a collapsing wave function back to the actual reality that's left. Due to this, the effects of Meta-Knowledge and similar effects don’t activate against your power. Whenever you utilize your ability, you can freely choose whether it manifests as a simulation or quantum superposition and swap between the two at any time.  
Coiling Snakes  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Copenhagen Interpretation  
You can swap objects between different timelines. If, for example, someone is dead in one timeline and alive in another, you can simply touch them in one timeline and swap them with their counterpart. You can also use this power on yourself.  
Coil  
Cost: 4 SP  
You can use precognition to follow two timelines where you make different choices.

Sole Looper  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Time-Loop  
Required: Blank, or (Stranger) Shroud  
Your Time-Loop has gained added security from your ability to evade detection from thinkers. Thanks to Shroud, you gain an adaptive local obfuscation to powers capable of perceiving or handling timelines, and difficulty of ascertaining changes or opportunities within your Time-Loop. It puts forward the notion that while these powers are aware of your Time-Loop, they're often confused or don't have any easy footing, as Shroud either distorts their perception to be misdirected.  
If you have Blank, your timeline is instead shifted onto a unique layer of reality, making all other powers that manipulate the timeline unable to detect or interact with your Time-Loop.

Ward Master  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Trump) Arcanist  
Required:(Trump/Tinker) Artificer  
Your Arcanist and Artificer powers synergize giving you access to the ability to create Wards, spells that are anchored to an area using ward stones. Wards can be connected together to pass information between them. Ward stones are not affected by the enchantment limit, be careful what you mix together however. If a wardstone is destroyed it will collapse all wards it is powering and those it is connected to.  
The Life Maker  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Trump/Tinker) Alchemist  
Required:(Trump/Tinker) Artificer  
You now have the knowledge and capability to create one of the most invaluable assets for production power: Manpower. This entity operates tirelessly, without the need for rest, sustenance, betrayal, or interruption unless absolutely necessary. It ranges from the "Inorganic" and "lifeless" Golems to the "alive" and "breathing" Homunculi.  
Golems are engineered for straightforward and systematic tasks, lacking creativity or deviation from their base orders. Conversely, Homunculi are "alive" entities capable of delicate tasks and some degree of "thinking outside the box" within their basic framework. While the creation and directives for these entities are not confined in scale and scope, humanoid forms of average size and capabilities prove the easiest and most efficient to manufacture.  
Regardless of the type you create, they all possess a "Core" component at their foundation, serving as the sole driving force. This core animates the materials comprising their form, which can vary from liquids, gases, solids, to even exotic types of matter, with the "core" being their principal weakness and the site of their most fundamental functions. The material of this core and the quality, quantity, and focus of the enchantment will define the general stats, modus operandi, and capabilities, such as speed of movement, carrying capacity, reaction time, and more.

Your "Magnum Opus" is the Holmcross, a Golem/Homunculus hybrid that embodies the best qualities of both at its base form. Crafted from Life-impregnated steel, blood (and organs), and magic, it possesses the remarkable ability of free thinking and growth, symbolizing a fusion of artistry, science, and magic.  
Corpse Puppetry  
Required:Lower Dantian  
Your knowledge of creating “life” has been expanded by your chi. The application of spiritual energy has allowed you to give this “life” back to the dead in the form of a corpse puppet, commonly called a Jiangshi.

A Jiangshi is a mindless servant created using dead bodies. This is not a zombie; the flesh and bone of the puppet is as “alive” as your other creations. The main benefit of this is that a Jiangshi can use the abilities it had in life, and in the case of parahumans, their powers as well. In the case of those with powers, they will require chi to be injected into their core to properly use them. They can still operate as a “normal” worker without chi but will be unable to use any of their powers.

Chi can also be applied to the cores of both your Golems, Homunculi, and even your Holmcrosses to strengthen them and prevent their destruction in both combat and harsh environments. It is also possible to combine all of your creations into a Holmpucross. The integration of your magnum open into a flesh puppet not only grants it free thinking and growth, but also the ability to drain chi on its own, turning its core into a pseudo-dantian. This will allow it to become much stronger and grow at a much faster rate.

Resurrection  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Striker) Redistribution of Pain  
Required:(Breaker/Mover) Puella Magi Homura Magika  
If you repair their corpse, you can bring anyone back to life. They will not have any brain damage or memory loss.  
[(Striker) Redistribution of Pain](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.ceisc66lfo3h)

Body Snatchers  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:Breed  
Required: Taylor Anne Hebert, or Skitter  
Your ability to create larvae and control insects is now fully synchronized, unlocking a new level of power. All creatures spawned through Breed now gain access to a breaker state—a parasitic form that allows them to invade and feed off a host from the inside. Once a parasite enters a host, it begins to rapidly drain their nutrients, leaving even the strongest individual frail and wasted within days. An obese person could be reduced to a skeletal, malnourished figure in a day or two.  
The parasite can control the host. The weaker the host, whether physically or mentally, the longer the parasite can maintain control over their body. During this time, the host’s body is not only sustained but enhanced by the parasite’s growing strength, amplified two or threefold by the nutrients they consume. The creature can also access the full range of their host’s memories and knowledge, using it to their advantage while the host is alive. If their host has a power, the creature may grow to replicate a version of said power.  
The host's death is inevitable, typically occurring within a week of infection, but all of the host’s knowledge, skills, and insights are preserved within the parasite even after death. After Host death, the parasite will be forced to leave its breaker state until it finds a new host. By this point it would have already grown greatly, at the very minimum they would have left their Larval state already.  
*The Flesh Betrays*  
Required:Dominion  
Your parasite can now take control over their host instantly instead of needing to wait for them to weaken. Furthermore, you now have a hive mind that can be accessed by you holding all the knowledge of all the independent creatures under your control. All knowledge the creature under your control is yours to use, even the stolen knowledge from the parasites. You no longer merely control the body but even have access to the mind.  
*They Hunger*  
Required:Skittering Legions  
Required:Muroidea Imperator  
When in control over a host, the creatures can choose to preserve their host’s life at the cost of forcing them into excruciating pain and making it so that the parasite is unable to enhance their host body when they take control. Using their half dead host, the parasites can create new larvae for you, each having in-built growths that resemble their parents. This will allow you to bypass the daily 9-10 limit.  
Mukade’s Skitterforge  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:Mukade  
Required: Taylor Anne Hebert, or Skitter  
You can now create a pair of any and all insects from the sides of your body. They will also gain superpower like biology, for example spiders will be able to make threads thinner than hair and stronger than tungsten, while remaining sticky enough that nothing has a chance to escape. Their stamina is tied with yours.  
*Ōmukade*  
Required:Bug Evolution  
The strength of the creatures you create is based on the amount of times you create them. The longer you have them created and more often you create them, the stronger and more mutated they become. At some point, you could, for example, create a centipede with enough venom to kill Alexandria.  
*Mukade’s Skittering Swarm*  
Required:Skittering Legions  
You are not limited to insects anymore, instead able to create a pair of super-versions of whatever you can control by your sides.  
Bug Evolution  
Cost: 12 SP  
Required:(Changer/Trump) Metamorphosis  
Required: Taylor Anne Hebert, or Skitter  
You can cause your bugs to rapidly grow and evolve, gaining special traits not naturally available, such as invisibility or fire breathing. Any additional powers you may have can be expressed through your bugs. (Bugs with tactile telekinesis, or bugs with natural biological tinkertech for example.)  
Your bugs also become more independent, able to understand and obey your orders even when outside your control. The longer a bug remains under your control, the greater the changes and stronger they become. You can even cannibalise other bugs under your control to increase the rate of other bugs mutations.  
*Skittering Swarm*  
Required:Skittering Legions  
You can mutate anything you can control, giving them traits from one another. The senses of a dog, the vitality of a roach, the toughness of a boar, etc..  
*Swarming Mutants*  
Required:Relay Bug  
The more an insect is mutated, the bigger they increase your range.  
*Monstrous Insects*  
Required:A Bug's Life  
You can transform into mutated bugs, although the more mutated the bugs you transform into the less bugs you transform into.  
Skittering Legions  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Rodent King  
Required: Taylor Anne Hebert, or Skitter  
You can control not only rodents and bugs, but any non-Sapient lifeforms not resistant to Master effects.  
Dominion  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:Skittering Legions  
Required:(Master) Khepri  
Your powers have fused, now your range is determined by the complexity of your target's minds. You could control all the bugs within a 5 kilometer radius or control all humans within a 200 meter range or anything in between. In addition to this, you gain a minor thinker power in relation to coordination, allowing you to do complex operations with those you are controlling. This allows you to have all those you are controlling to seamlessly work together.  
*Hive*  
Required:A Bug's Life  
You can fuse anything you can control together to create clones of anyone you have controlled. These clones are completely under your control, and have all of their original powers. The clone bodies must remain within 200 meters of yourself, as they will break apart back to their base components if not. If you make clones of yourself, they will also have a personal power radius which can increase the range of your control.  
Muroidea Imperator  
Cost: 9 SP  
Required:(Master) Ratatouille  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Rodent King  
You can now enhance rats that you control, but doing so results in decreasing your ability to sense through them. Your rats will all gain the ability to independently grow by eating.  
Your rats can gain the traits of what they eat. If they eat a dog, they can gain slightly enhanced senses. If they eat the flesh of a parahuman, they can gain a minor power based off their target. For example, if they eat a pyrokinetic they can gain the ability to rapidly heat their body although this will still burn them if they can’t handle the temperature. If they eat the corona potentia (or the brain if Shardless) they can gain a variant of the target’s powers.  
Your rats can breed with one another, letting the powers they may have fuse and awaken in their children. The pups will need only 1 day to mature.  
After reaching a certain size, about 5x their original size, they will mature, with their growth altered, and they will instead slowly become more humanoid. Their humanoid form will still be obviously non-human. They will grow more intelligent, and you will lose direct control over them in exchange they will be extremely loyal to you, seeing you as their creator and obeying you even when out of your range.  
Any rat you vomit out now will come out fully matured. However any ability and/or mutation of your vomited rat has must have been gained by another one of your natural rats, in other words you cannot create new abilities, only recreate ones already gained.  
*Legionarius*  
Required:Skittering Legions  
Anything you control now can grow via eating, growing in size, strength and intelligence. They are also able to gain powers through the same methods of your rats.  
Beyond that, they also gain the ability to gain minor powers through eating objects or creatures. Eating more of that objects or creatures, or similar objects or creatures, will strengthen that power, or to gain a new power from that object.  
They can only have up to 5 of these powers active at once, with each power growing no more than 3 SP.  
Your creatures can breed with one another, even crossbreeding being possible, letting the powers and mutations they have fuse and awaken in their children. These children will always grow to be stronger than their parents, by at minimum 1%.

You can also vomit and create any creature you control. They will be fully matured upon creation, however any ability and/or mutation of your vomited creature must have been gained by another one of your natural creatures, in other words you cannot create new abilities, only recreate ones already gained.  
*Monstrum*  
Required:Skittering Legions  
Required:Bug Evolution  
All the creatures under your control now passively evolve, their natural traits pushing past their natural limits and becoming minor powers in their own right. A spider’s venom capable of killing regenerators, a dog’s sense capable of detecting stranger effects, etc. Any minor power they may gain through eating is now reflected upon their appearance, and can grow to a maximum of 5 SP, with no limit on how many minor powers they can have.  
Once they become humanoid, they will gain a specialized power based on all their powers and mutations. Their specialized power will be no weaker than that of an average parahuman. They can only gain one specialized power through maturity.  
Children of your creatures will inherit a weaker version of both their parent’s specialized powers, and will gain a derivative of these powers after reaching maturity.  
*Typhoeus*  
Required:Skittering Legions  
Required:A Bug's Life  
You can transform into a swarm of your mutated and/or hybrid creatures, however any ability and/or mutation of your created swarm must have been gained by another one of your natural creatures, in other words you cannot create new abilities, only recreate ones already gained. In addition, within a limited range of your “body” you can have complete control over any of your creatures, even if they have completely matured.  
*Deus Rattorum*  
Required:Chitter  
Your control over your rats no longer degrades as you mutate and improve them. They can still act independently and will be loyal if they leave you range. You can choose to give them independence or to completely control them down to their involuntary actions.  
Breed  
Cost: 11 SP  
You can create about 9-10 fully autonomous larval parasites a day. These parasites are purely instinct-based, unable to learn, and generally prioritize attacking vulnerable humans or uninfected human corpses in order to turn them into a hive and grow, although they will abandon stealth to attack other targets in the case that you or they are threatened. In their larval state, they are roughly the size of lemons, appearing similar to a trilobite with a barbed shell hard enough to resist conventional ammunition & weapons, sharp claws and a long stinger tail. In this state, they tend to find hiding places to lie in wait to ambush and burrow into their victims' orifices, waiting until they're still for a while before paralyzing them so that they can call their siblings using pheromones and collectively devour the victim from the inside out.  
As they feed upon more victims, they will grow bigger and bolder, finally capping out at human size, at which point they will develop several dangerous natural weapons, such as a shotgun spray of pellets containing a powerful acid.  
Mukade  
Cost: 3 SP  
You’re a master, who summons centipede-like creatures from the sides of your body. These centipedes are half a foot wide, two inches tall, and have serrated razor sharp legs. They have mouths that can spew acid, and bodies that channel this acid in certain directions. The fluids are luminescent in the light and black in the dark.  
Chitter  
Cost: 3 SP  
You have the ability to control a large amount of rats in a radius, able to command them and get some crude sensory feedback from them.

Meta Knowledge  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required: Blank, or (Stranger) Shroud  
Required: Sarah Livsey/Lisa Wilbourn, Tattletale, Dinah Alcott, or Kid Cassandra  
You know when you're being simulated and can either act differently in the simulation or just shut the simulation off altogether. You recall all simulated memories after the simulation ends unless the simulated version of you decides otherwise.  
[Tattletale](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10iXeteuLtMn8lAAAEjSYL5M_GQZsBYuDL9xo5bJ-QRQ/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0#bookmark=id.k93j81l4dnwv)

Fractured No More  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required: (Trump) Aliena, (Trump) Eidolon, or (Breaker/Trump) Ignis Fatuus  
Required:(Master/Trump) Endbringer Engine  
It seems your Endbringer Engine isn’t some mere downgraded emulation but a fully fledged version. As a result, the strength of the powers you can hold in Administrator power has massively increased and your ability to control and design your Endbringer’s powers if further enhanced.  
With Negentropy you are a true nightmare and the final strength of your Endbringers is raised to 80SP (however the growth rate is still 1sp per month).  
*A Super Administrator and their Army of Nightmares*  
Required: Paradigm, Endless Reflection, Synthesis Forge, or Imperator  
With the increase in power of your Administrator power you have not only doubled the rate of growth of your summoned Endbringers but also spawned three new abilities.  
First, the scale of the powers that can be stored in your Administrator power’s slots has further increased.  
Secondly, you can now summon a temporary additional fully grown Endbringer at the cost of a high tier 3 powers from your Administrator power. Furthermore, you also have the ability to do the opposite, shutting down an Endbringer to gain access to an additional high tier 3 power for yourself to use.  
Finally, can now fuse with and take control of any one of your Endbringers, allowing you access to both your Administrator power and that Endbringers abilities and durability.  
However, be mindful that all of your Endbringers and your own abilities all draw energy from the same source. Meaning using too many Endbringers abilities without Negentropy runs the risk of completely depleting your shard.

Maker of the End  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Blasto  
Required:(Tinker) Crystals\!  
Required:Bonesaw  
Your specialties have fused into a greater whole, allowing for the creation of semi-sentient, hyperdense, and crystalline constructs. In order to create these constructs, your Shard has given you 2 secondary powers:  
Material Expansion: You can grow any biological or crystal-based material via touch. You can control the minute details of this expansion. For example, if someone had brain damage, you could regrow it in such a way that they are loyal solely to you. You don't have to touch the exact organ: you could regrow someone's heart with a handshake.  
Density Expansion: With a touch, you can expand the density of any biological or crystal based material. Interestingly, this change in density does not impact weight. You can use this power in either direction, increasing something's density to the point of invulnerability or spreading it thin enough to be invisible.

You can affect yourself indirectly by cutting off flesh, applying your powers, and reattaching it.  
With these new capabilities, you can easily create beings like Blasto's failed Simurgh clone, Morrigan. Your creations have high Brute and Mover ratings, resilient enough to endure several blows by Alexandria-level Brutes. With resources and time, you can create Conflict Sentinels, the weaker version of Endbringers planned by Eden. However, these creations of yours do not have unique powers beyond their Brute rating and any biological abilities you add in yourself.  
Your power has a unique interaction with Endbringer Flesh. Instead of your power failing to act, you can slowly apply your Material and Density Expansion to create more. If you somehow had access to an Endbringer flesh sample with all of the layers, you could create a perfect Endbringer clone, including the powers. However, this will require extensive research. Your creations literally live and die for your goals, like the Simurgh.  
You are an expert in creating crystal-based biological components, living crystal organisms, and manipulating/creating Cauldron Vials from Shards. You can generally determine how mixing certain Shards will impact the final product, and minimize (or maximize) the risk of horrific mutations. If you had access to an Entity corpse and several "volunteers", you may even be able to perfect the formula completely.  
(Tinker) Self-Alteration  
Cost: 12 SP  
You are a Bio-Tinker/Protestician Hybrid that is focused on self-improvement. It is similar to Bonesaw's power, as the both of you will be able to learn a lot from each other, finding it easier to understand what each other's powers did and how they did them.  
This could be easily combined with most Tinker powers, with a few such as Bakuda being an exception.  
(Tinker) I Wanna Be The Very Best\!  
Cost: 15 SP  
You are a biotinker similar to Blasto, you are able to make hybridized creatures. But instead of being limited to plants, they can be a plethora of elements. To shadow human-tigers to crystal reptile birds, to even flame breathing dragons.  
Bonesaw  
Cost: 12 SP  
You are a powerful biotinker specializing in medical sciences.  
Blasto  
Cost: 3 SP  
You are a biotinker specialized in creating lifeforms.

City Killer  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:(Breaker) Density  
Required:(Striker/Blaster) Fiery Moves  
Required:Tidecaller  
Required:(Mover/Breaker) Veloci…Raptor?  
Required:(Shaker) Storm  
Your powers have greatly grown, mirroring Leviathan.  
You are a macro-scale hydrokinetic, the base range of hydrokinesis is now the size of a large city such as New York, and can be further extended to the size of an extremely large island, such as Newfoundland or Kyushu. Your control is also better, and you can manipulate liquid water as if it was another limb. Your control now extends to non-liquid forms of water, such as steam and ice, though this control is much weaker than liquid water. However, with some time you are capable of converting them back into a liquid state.  
Your ability to manipulate density is also extended to your water. Any water you control is automatically dense enough to rip through steel, and grows denser the longer you control it. You can also build up water pressure and tension, allowing you to level a city using aquifers given enough time.  
Your speed is greatly enhanced, and you are now capable of moving up to Mach 3 on a bad day. This speed is increased to ridiculous levels in water, you can move so quickly that you are essentially teleporting. Despite your increased speed, your flexibility and dexterity are immeasurable, you could simultaneously perform several complex surgeries at once without any error.  
Rather than creating fiery copies, you now leave a water "echo" whenever you move. For instance, if you make a casual swipe of your hand, instead of the displaced air filling the space back up, it is replaced with water compressed enough to tear through buildings. This water follows the direction and speed you were moving at, so if you launch a punch at Mach 3 and suddenly stop, the water echo will be moving at hypersonic speeds. This is normal water, so hydrokinetics (including yourself) can control it. Weapons and equipment count as part of yourself.  
(If you have Queen Shard, your only blindspot is the Entity and you are a blindspot that no one but the Entity is partially immune to.)  
*Jörmungandr*  
Required:(Changer) The End-Becomer  
Required: Noble, or Shardless  
You are Leviathan, in the flesh. Your Endbringer form not only inherits all of Leviathan’s powers but is also unshackled from all the possible restrictions and directives he was placed for the Cycle.  
Speed and proper perception are refined to grander levels both on land and water, with Mach 15 on land while Mach 50 while underwater or there’s water around, traveling at dizzying speeds throughout the world.  
Your restriction of fine water control is lifted, able to manipulate any substance or material containing water around you, bring forth meteorological phenomena like downpours and storms, tsunamis, creating water pressures on aquifers around coasts eroding the coastland’s integrity to the point of sinking cities or islands on its own.  
If Leviathan exists in the world you are in, you can retroactively take his place.

Hope Killer  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Simurgh Lite  
Required:Songbird  
Required:(Thinker) Laplace Demon  
Required:(Shaker) Telekinesis  
Your powers have greatly grown, mirroring the Simurgh.  
You temporarily gain access to all Thinker/Tinker powers within a 10-kilometer radius. You retain these powers for a day after they leave your radius, and retain a weakened version of their power, having around 20% strength of the original. Additionally, you are able to recreate and reconfigure tinkertech in your range even if their tinker isn’t there, although you will not be able to retain its ability.  
Your singing can act as a sonar, allowing you to scan the area by singing. Your voice also has been enhanced, allowing your song to cover an entire city. The longer you sing, the further your song reaches, growing at an exponential rate. You can sense through whoever hears your song, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel. You also gain a boost in your understanding of the subtleties of the mind, allowing you to make minor, but profound changes to your target's mind, ones that may not be discovered for years.  
Through the info gained from singing, your simulations have been greatly boosted. Now, even without singing, you can effortlessly simulate up to a few months into the future/past. Through your sonar-like singing, you can perfectly simulate at minimum 1 and a half years into the future/past of everything that will happen in the area, and through your memory reading, you can perfectly simulate everything the target has once experienced, and their various possible futures.

Your telekinesis has grown too, allowing you to telekinetically carry entire cars with little effort. Your fine control is great enough that you can construct extremely fine technology with your telekinesis. Your weight limit is also now only counted for individual objects rather than the total of everything you are carrying.  
*Ziz*  
Required:(Changer) The End-Becomer  
Required: Noble, or Shardless  
You are now the Simurgh, in the flesh. Your Endbringer form not only inherits all of the Simurgh’s powers but is also free from all the limits she was placed on.  
You can create any piece of technology from the past or future, as long as you have interacted with it in those times. Your precognitive abilities allow you to plan tens of thousands of years in advance with ease. In addition, with a glance, you can perfectly analyse a person, from the day they are born to the day they die. You subconsciously nudge things your way, making small changes to meet your long-term goals. Your control over matter is complete as your telekinesis can tear apart atoms and even nudge the Earth in its orbit, with effort.  
If the Simurgh exists in the world you are in, you can retroactively take her place.

Hero Killer  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Mover) Ground Diver  
Required:(Shaker/Thinker) Orchestra  
Required:(Shaker) Electromagnetic Warping  
Required:(Brute) Yang it\!  
Required:(Brute/Breaker) The Duke  
Required:Ruler of the Primordial Flames  
Your powers have greatly grown, mirroring Behemoth.  
All of Behemoth’s known abilities are merely manifestations of his Energy Manipulation, while you imitate an approximation.  
You’re a Tank rivaling the greatest of Brute short from Alexandria, although something of a close one at that. Your strength and durability work side by side for excessive shows of brute force, creating earthquakes from stomping or punching the ground with enough strength, producing powerful shockwaves with each physical action, with every part of your being radiating strength.  
Furthermore, your ability to absorb kinetic energy from opposing attacks has grown more powerful, allowing for you to exponentially increase your durability along with your strength.  
Your ability to control flames and heat has spread to a destructive quality, breaking havoc on anything and anyone to the point it reaches 1400°C, turning a rock into magma used as projectiles or collateral. Your handle of fire, and heat, so their phenomena is clear-cut enough to extend to volcanic fields, explosive forces, and the like.  
Your manipulation of physical forces is specialized in energy, uplifting your abilities. Your range has expanded to 500m², able to manipulate electricity to guide and control lighting on your own or cause electromagnetic pulses, radiation, and sonic energy to emulate Behemoth’s signature roars and absorb or redirect energy. You can use this as a sixth sense around you.  
The resulting combination of your abilities is the creation of a smaller but no less intimidating Kill Aura around 5m², you bypass the Manton Effect and manifest energy from within anyone close enough, immolating them from the inside.  
You can let out a majestic roar at will, by controlling sonic energy. This roar gradually grows more powerful until it can tear out eyeballs and cause buildings to shudder.  
(If you have Normal Shard, then you have normal shard blindspots. If you have Vital shard, you are a natural blindspot to most thinkers, with only the Endbringers partially immune and the Entity fully immune, and your only blindspots are the Endbringers and the Entity. If you have Queen Shard, your only blindspot is the Entity and you are a blindspot that no one but the Entity is partially immune to.)  
*Hadhayosh*  
Required:(Changer) The End-Becomer  
Required: Noble, or Shardless  
You are Behemoth, in the flesh. Your Endbringer form not only inherits all of Behemoth’s powers but is also unshackled from all the possible restrictions and directives he was placed for the Cycle.  
Your command over energy applies to all types of energy in the physical world, being a master at it. Your range is near Mr. Worldwide both in perception and utilization. Common demonstrations are complete and utter disruption of the electromagnetic layers, changing the Earth’s relief map from massive faults, volcanic eruptions, and the resulting earthquakes, and simply becoming a living bomb sufficient to sink the world into a Dark Age.  
If Behemoth exists in the world you are in, you can retroactively take his place.  
*Terror Drone*  
Required:City Killer  
Required:Hope Killer  
Required:(Changer) The End-Becomer  
Required: Noble, or Shardless  
You are to Endbringers what Endbringers are to humans. Your existence has retroactively altered history, removing Endbringers in its entirety. You gain access to an additional 20 Endbringer cores, as well as granting you the powers of Tohu, Bohu and Khonsu. Beyond that you gain all the powers in the Endbringer Power Section. You can use any of these powers at once.  
Each of your abilities are massively enhanced, and even more so when in your Endbringer form. Each Endbringer power you do purchase is also mutated and amplified, becoming far more flexible and powerful as well as losing any of its restrictions, enough to defeat 3 other Terror Drones with just one of the Endbringer powers. That is not all however, you can choose to have your Endbringer cores divert their power solely to empowering any of your powers, multiplying its strength upon itself for every core diverted to it. Which core empowers which power can be altered at any time.  
If you somehow die, it will destroy one of the 21 cores you have. After its destruction you can revive and gain a power set perfectly made to counter the previous attacks/powers. This can also be done without death, and/or directed allowing you to generate a new power set based on conscious, or subconscious if you allow it, desires, although this will typically take longer.  
Any destroyed cores will naturally regenerate after a month, although additional powers can increase the speed of this. If Negentropic/Shardless this regeneration is dropped down to a day and you can generate a new core every month.  
Be aware that options that increase the amount of Endbringers will increase the total number of cores you have available, and options that increase the strength of Endbringers will increase your own.  
*The End*  
Required:City Killer  
Required:Hope Killer  
Required:Engine of Escalation  
Required:(Master) Bringer of the End  
Required:Paradigm  
Required:(Changer) The End-Becomer  
Required: Noble, or Shardless  
Even the greatest and most powerful of Terror Drones are nothing but ants before you. You are the greatest threat the world has ever known, they could bring armies of parahumans, Titans, and Endbringers to bear against you and all they could hope to accomplish is to die quickly, for they would be nothing more than gnats caught in the winds of a cataclysmic storm.  
Your powers build upon itself once more, amplifying and increasing to absolutely terrifying levels, you are going against the very principles of what an Entity would allow to exist. Your Endbringers powers are converted into slots for Paradigm as normal, however they are supercharged, adding the equivalent of what you would have had as a Terror Done on top of each Paradigm’s slots power which is in turn empowered to the same degree your Endbringer form would have empowered your abilities. Your physical abilities are similarly enhanced, each core in use amplifying them further. Your cores now empower every ability you possess, although you can choose to focus them for greater effect. Beyond that you are immune to pain, debilitation, physical needs, and permanent injury, able to operate at full effectiveness even when reduced to nothing more than a single core. You also receive alien senses that depend on what powers you use, able to perceive the world directly through your abilities even when your form is reduced to nothing.

The number of additional cores you have available to you has gone up to 100, however what a core means has gotten a little loose. They’ve become as flexible as your own form. You can now freely modify the nature of your own form and cores as well as any of your Endbringers.  
Do you wish to be an angelic monster made of pure fractal light, your death requiring the destruction of your ever shining core in complete darkness? Maybe as a living equation whose presence is expressed by the strange warping of reality as you pass through it, only able to be slain if you're unraveled by a complex mathematical formula that renders you down to zero? Maybe even as nothing more than a normal human, your cores being the lives of others, possessing the durability of a core and the regeneration of an Endbringer, unable to die unless those people are first killed.

As before, you can freely change your nature and cores as easily as you can your own form. The full destruction of your form, your cores, and your other Endbringers is needed to kill you. You can split off your own cores to create other Human/Endbringer forms, one for each form, if you desire. Each form can be given its own unique shape and nature, and they can be made entirely autonomous from you although still follow any commands or desires, subconscious or otherwise.

Your ability to construct power sets is now instantaneous, no longer requiring death. Instead in order to combat you someone must bring to bear an unholy amount of different powers and tactics and use them fast enough that you don’t adapt, a very unlikely scenario. More than likely all they’ll manage to do is delay the inevitable.

You can allow the Endbringers to have existed once more, each as powerful as the most powerful Terror Drones with a single core from you. Their powers and forms are as malleable as your own and they can each possess any power and perk you would have possessed at the same scale as you would have without this addon, although your own will still bypass theirs. You can gift them any of your own abilities and/or Paradigm slots for greater effect, and can reclaim it at will. They will each possess one of your cores rather than their own as they are formed from you. You can choose whether they existed before you and you are now taking over, or whether they were always from you, even unwittingly if you are a reincarnation.  
You can freely create more by casting off one of your cores to construct one. Each additional core they are granted increases their power as they would your own. You can also assign a Core to another, turning them into an Endbringer and granting and/or amplifying their power to match. When regenerating a core you can use this to resurrect others you’ve made into Endbringers. You can reclaim your core and remove their status as Endbringers whenever you wish. Anyone who’s been transformed into any Endbringers will have their powers replicated as a new power set for yourself, if they had any. You’ll retain it even if they stop being an Endbringer after. If you're a reincarnation or character insert you may retroactively turn your companions and/or other people that are close to you into Endbringers. You can reabsorb any made Endbringers and their cores back into yourself as well, and can communicate with, use their senses and see their memories, and take over their forms at will. You can alter their personalities and programming at will, same way you would their form.  
Cores will regenerate within a day and a new one can be generated in a month (1 Hour/1 Week for Negentropic/Shardles s), cores can be pushed outside of your body and left somewhere else, acting as a seed to regrow your body. A single seed core can regrow your body within a day. The more cores you carry the faster your regeneration is in general, your cores can also be allocated into a pocket dimension, being shoved into your form when the previous one is destroyed allowing you to continue fighting without having to regenerate around another core. You can render a core inert if you wish, allowing you to regenerate it if you ever need to for some reason, such as being unable to retrieve a seed core. You carry all your power and abilities in both human and Endbringer forms. Options that increase the power of Endbringers will also increase your own, and options that increase the amount of them will also increase the amount of cores you possess.

Gate of Babylon  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Shaker/Blaster) Bag of Holding  
Required:(Trump/Tinker) Enchantment  
You have access to every mythical treasure thought up by man before the year 1900 and can open portals to your pocket dimension. Items can be launched from your pocket dimension at the speed of sound. No weapon stronger than a continent-destroyer can be found in your pocket dimension.

Biobringer  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Changer) Self-Biokinesis  
Required: Panacea, or Amy Dallon  
You have absolute control and understanding of all carbon based lifeforms. You also can control biology at three times the rate you could before.  
Biomass Generation  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Changer) Self-Biokinesis  
Required: (Brute) Deadpool, or (Brute) Avalon  
When altering yourself with Self-Biokinesis you are not limited by the matter in your body, you can create extra matter from nothing  
Fleshy Bits  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Biomass Generation  
Required:Biobringer  
As long as it originally came from your own body, you can control/sense/use your powers through your flesh regardless of range.  
Panacea  
Cost: 14 SP  
You have touch-range biokinesis. You can only use this on others, not yourself. You have an instinctual understanding of most biology, but even so, you cannot always understand biological-based Parahuman powers, such as the biological armor of Bitch's dogs.  
(Changer) Self-Biokinesis  
Cost: 11 SP  
You have total control over your internal biology and appearance. This can only transform away Case 53 if you mess with your Corona Pollentia and Corona Gemma so that they don't turn you back into a Case 53\.

### Power Upgrade

Oh It’s Personal Now  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Trump) Bodycount  
By delving into the lives of your targets, your counter’s gains grow exponentially. A normal kill still adds just 1 point to the counter, but if you take the time to learn about them—such as their name, where they lived, their daily habits, or who they loved—the points gained increases exponentially. The more knowledge you have, the greater the increase. Knowledge is literally power for you to reap, and the more intimate your understanding of a life extinguished, the stronger you become.  
(Trump) Bodycount  
Cost: 9 SP  
A counter exists in your mind, tracking the number of people you’ve killed. Every kill increases the counter by 1\. For each increment of the counter, all your physical, mental, and other abilities increase by 1%. If the counter shows 2, your abilities are enhanced by 2%. If it reaches 10, you gain a 10% boost, and so on, with no upper limit to what you can achieve. Your power thrives on the destruction you sow, making every kill an investment in your own growth.

Pillow Fort  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Striker/Trump) Teddybear  
Your reach and versatility has exponentially expanded as you can now propagate (Striker/Trump) Teddybear through and beyond any material connected to your initial point of contact, up to a maximum of 200 metres away. You're no longer limited to just objects directly touching you; you may now have remote objects serve as a manifestation of yourself as long as there is an indirect physical link.  
For example, you could extend this effect from your feet, through your shoes, into the ground and onto a nearby door. If you had a Brute power, the door would gain your Brute aspect. This power cannot extend through organic matter.  
Channeling  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Striker/Trump) Teddybear  
You can use your powers through your powers, through things made by you, and through the consequences of your powers/creations. If the channeled power cannot do anything to what it is being used on it will change in order to be able to do so.  
Channeling Tattletale through tinkertech repaired by (Tinker) Repair would make Tattletale get no wrong information about the tech and would increase its deduction capacities in relation to it and anything similar. Channeling (Blaster) Bloody Hell through a wound made by (Striker) Edge would make the blood within the wound erase matter around itself. Channeling (Trump) Eidolon through a knife made by you would result in the knife gaining three random powers made specifically to work with knives.  
(Striker/Trump) Teddybear  
Cost: 2 SP  
You can use objects as an expression of yourself. Such as the tip of a spear counting for your Striker powers or clothes as part of your Brute powers.

Tinker Shard Support  
Cost: 5 SP  
Your shard's influence over your tinkering now extends to the tinker tech you create. Your shard will constantly support the performance of any tinker tech you make instead of just aiding your tinkering process. This includes providing limited automatic maintenance for your tinker tech, such as repair and cleaning, as well as partially supplying some of the basic necessary energy and materials for its continued functionality.  
Your shard can provide up to 50% of any required fuel and matter for your tinker tech's sustained operation. Your shard's ability to repair your tinker tech extends to being able to restore up to 10% of the mass of any of your tinker constructs if they are damaged. As such, your tinker tech still requires sufficient traditional energy and material input to continue functioning, along with your assistance in the event of major damage or equipment failure.  
A consequence of this effect is that anything capable of blocking your shard will also impact your tinker tech, returning it to operating as normal. This can be negated by Trumped the Trump. Excessively vast material and energy demands can potentially result in your Shard running out of energy although Negentropy or Shardless negates this.  
*Tinker's Extended Warranty*  
Required:Shard Spark  
The loosening of your shard's restrictions on its capacity to manipulate the laws of physics while you construct Tinker tech has consequently also significantly boosted the level to which it can distort reality to maintain your Tinker tech.  
Instead of its previous 50%, your shard can now meet up to 100% of your Tinker tech's basic fuel, energy and matter consumption demands to ensure it continues working. Furthermore, your Shard's ability to automatically repair your damaged Tinker tech has also improved. It is now capable of restoring and repairing any damage present, up to a total of 30% of your Tinker tech's mass, regardless of which components are missing or impaired.

Heterodyning  
Cost: 7 SP  
You tinker far faster than should be physically possible.  
You also require fewer tools and equipment to do so, materials and components seemingly altering themselves to suit your design.

Shard Spark  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required: Heterodyning  
Your shard's manipulation of reality while you build Tinkertech has become even more blatant. Not only are components altered to suit your design, but you now unconsciously manifest small amounts of materials and energy out of seemingly nothing. Even space and time are subtly warped while you're in the midst of your tinker fugue, enabling you to tinker impossibly fast.  
You can freely adjust how much your shard warps reality when tinkering. At a minimum, you're the same as a normal tinker

Striker → Shaker  
Cost: 5 SP  
Your Striker powers, be they touch-based or melee ranged, have now also developed a Shaker aspect if possible.  
This means your Striker powers can be freely projected over a distance rather than being limited to touch or close quarters. Striker powers which initially possessed some form of limited range component will have this factor significantly enhanced while touch-based Striker powers will develop a ranged component.

The new maximum distance or area these powers can affect depends on the power. Striker powers with a small melee range aspect have their maximum range limit multiplied by 100\. If the Striker power is touch-based, it can gain a ranged aspect that either: a) matches the maximum range the power had via touch, or b) operates up to within 100 feet of yourself, whichever distance is greater. Standard Manton Limits still apply unless otherwise stated.

Cryptologist  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Pattern Recognition  
Your skill at finding patterns has now been greatly enhanced to cover the field of "cryptology." This not only refers to actual ciphers and scripts, but any act of "prying into mystery." With cursory investigation, you can psychoanalyze the intentions, motivations, and desires of others. With a serious investigation, you can decrypt the true names of Shards based on a Parahuman.  
You can supernaturally unravel any sort of linguistic concealment or mathematical cipher by finding relations between words, numbers, and keys to determine the encryption method. For example, you could complete the thousands of steps to turn a coded language into actual words, or find the password of an important account via solely the public key. This only helps you find patterns in the information you already know. The reverse is also possible. You have the ability to create long and complex systems of encryption to encode all sorts of information. This applies from programming, physical messages, etc. to more obscure things like your mental state.  
You gain a natural boost to your deduction capabilities and thinking speed. Your mind performs calculations at a speed far faster than an ordinary civilian can comprehend. This is to the extent that you can thoroughly analyze the longest and most complex mathematical proofs in a matter of seconds.  
(Thinker) Pattern Recognition  
Cost: 5 SP  
You are extremely good at learning and memorizing patterns. This allows you to quickly analyze an opponent’s attack sequences and movements, enabling you to predict their next actions based on observed behaviors. By identifying small changes in their strategy, you can make precise adjustments to counter their attacks or exploit weaknesses. Your accuracy is only limited by the information available, but once enough data is gathered, you can anticipate even subtle shifts. For example, after observing an opponent’s attack style for a short time, you can recognize their preferred moves—whether it’s a tendency to strike low after a feint or to rely on quick jabs between heavy hits, and from there you can “herd” them to your desired position.

Demon Possession  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Master) Heart Demon  
If the target dies through the strain of their hearts, the Heart Demon can fully manifest, gaining their host's abilities, warped by the negativity the Heart Demon is made of. The Heart Demons are loyal to you, however this loyalty isn't absolute. They can and will disobey orders, especially when it goes against their nature (which for most Heart Demons include positive acts).  
If you have Regrets Behind You then the manifested Heart Demon will be far stronger, even gaining whatever reward their host would have had if they had succeeded.  
Regrets Behind You  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Master) Heart Demon  
Now if you wish you can make a different variant of Heart Demons. These can give a greater reward for defeating them, at a dangerous cost of failure. These Heart Demons are more aggressive and stronger, meaning if you are too weak willed it is likely you will die in a few hours in pain and agony. However, if you manage to defeat this specific type of Heart Demon, you will gain a boon. For people who have no powers, they will Trigger and gain one tailored to the trauma they moved past. For people with powers, their powers gain a major boost in strength and gain thematic boosts based on their trauma, which for Parahumans is likely their trigger event.  
(Master) Heart Demon  
Cost: 6 SP  
With a touch you can awaken a Heart Demon in someone. This Heart Demon will take the form of some issue that the target is facing. At the start it will be very weak, only appearing in dreams to torment its target. But the longer the issue festers, the stronger the Heart Demon becomes. Given enough time or if the target spirals from the given issue, the Heart Demon can actively manipulate the target's senses and even temporarily control them when they feel negative emotions. The stronger the Heart Demon, the more strain it causes on the target's heart, literally. If it gets strong enough the target will die from a heart attack. The only way to defeat the Heart Demon is through accepting and moving past whatever issue the Heart Demon is feeding on. For example, if it is feeding on trauma from a specific incident, the only way to defeat it is to move past your trauma.  
*Heart of Sin*  
Required:(Master/Trump) Sin Manifestation  
You can choose to fuse the Heart Demon you made with the monster created based on the sins of the target. In this form, the Heart Demon can grow stronger the more sins the target has done. Simply getting over whatever issue the Heart Demon feeds from is not enough, for it now embodies every sin they have done. The only way to survive is to repent for every sin they have done, and for every second they don't the Heart Demon will force them to suffer just as they made others suffer. If they don't fully repent fast enough or the Heart Demon becomes strong enough, they will die.

Out of the Mouth Comes Evil  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Oracle of Delphi  
In addition to receiving legitimate prophecies about the future, you can now say whatever you want and declare it as a prophecy, which will modify causality to make the event more likely. Want to win the lottery? A few words, and it's yours. Have a rival you despise but cannot touch? Tomorrow, they somehow don't remember to put on their mask when caping. These events will have no trace of your involvement and will appear completely natural, often just attributed to good or bad luck. However, if you continuously create unrealistic occurrences around someone, they could realize something is off.  
The more realistic a possibility is, the greater the chance that it occurs after you create a prophecy. Conversely, the more important/powerful a person, event, or location is, the harder it is to influence. Something like controlling a coin toss would have a near-perfect accuracy rate while getting Contessa to forget her morning coffee would have a far greater chance of failure. Rather than complete failure, most high-level prophecies only achieve partial success, with some aspects of your declared prophecy coming true or to a less absolute degree. For example, a prophecy stopping someone's resurrection could instead slow it down. However, even the most likely occurrences have a small chance of total failure.  
This ability can be used to influence anyone/anything on the planet and can be used repeatedly on the same target(s) without consequence, though it raises the possibility of someone noticing something is off. You can declare prophecies by writing them on any surface or speaking them out loud. Nobody has to hear your prophecies for them to come true.  
Melpomene  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Oracle of Delphi  
You are truly a child of despair and tragedy. As a seer of doom, your prophecies now hold even more weight when they foretell suffering, loss, or catastrophe. Your predictions related to dark events—such as illness, injury, death, and ruin—become unerringly precise and amplified. You can foresee with uncanny accuracy the key figures, specific locations, and exact dates and times of catastrophic events. Sometimes, you are even granted vivid flashes of the future, moments in which you witness unfolding scenes in startling detail, allowing you to identify the individuals whose actions or fates will play pivotal roles in these looming crises.  
Alongside this ominous foresight, a new ability manifests within you: a penetrating insight into the darkest facets of human nature. With a mere glance, you perceive a person’s most hidden flaws and shameful secrets. Their sins, their vices, and the weight of their guilt are laid bare before you, leaving no room for pretense.  
*Song of Despair*  
Required:Out of the Mouth Comes Evil  
Your power intensifies whenever you choose to bring misfortune upon others. You can weave a series of minor negative events that, when combined, lead to devastating outcomes far beyond mere bad luck. Small injuries may worsen into severe illness, a minor conflict may escalate into betrayal, or an accident may result in death—or even something worse than death. With each curse you declare, you can set off a chain of miseries that erode the well-being, sanity, and even the soul of your target.  
Your curses work like threads woven into the fabric of someone’s life, subtly and invisibly binding them to a path of suffering. These events will still appear perfectly natural, with no trace of your involvement, often dismissed as unfortunate circumstances. But as minor ailments become life-threatening diseases, and fleeting anxieties deepen into madness, those who fall victim to your power are caught in a downward spiral that feels inevitable, as if fate itself has turned against them.  
However, as before, the scale and impact of your prophecies depend on the significance of the target. Influencing powerful individuals or deeply fated events remains challenging, and the most intense curses may manifest partially or in distorted ways. Yet, with persistence, even the mightiest can find themselves slowly undone by an endless series of “bad days.”  
*Cassandra*  
Required: (Thinker) Twisted World , or (Thinker) Ghostmates  
When you look at a person, their innermost self is unveiled to you in vivid detail. Every shameful secret, every hidden flaw, every regret and vice they try to conceal is laid bare, exposed with stark clarity.  
But it doesn’t end there. You witness not only the burdens they carry but the path that stretches ahead of them—their future, marred by looming failures, by the heartbreaks and missteps yet to come. When you look into a person’s future, your vision is limited to the shadows that lie ahead. You don’t see their joys or triumphs; instead, only the negative fragments are revealed to you. You witness their failures, their regrets, and the moments of despair that await them. These glimpses show only the heartbreaks, disappointments, and struggles that will mark their journey.  
At the end of this path, you see their death—a hazy, shifting image of how they might die. The image is fluid, ever-changing, because even the act of your observation subtly alters the future. Your vision of their end is like a flickering candle, casting shadows that evolve and reshape with every glance.  
(Thinker) Oracle of Delphi  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can tell prophecies in the form of poems that can tell the future. These futures CAN be changed. If no party who hears a prophecy tries to change it, it will happen. This power's only blindspot is your home universe, but when talking about the entity or Endbringers, it will be vaguer than usual.

Malum  
Cost: 17 SP  
Required:(Shaker) Hazardous Disaster  
Your disastrous area widens to an area of 1km², with your initial limitations all but gone.  
You now summon a ton of natural crises and discharge them accumulatively, hurling one endgame scenario after another, in all directions. The possibilities broaden, with all the disasters the Entities encountered across their Cycles, both natural and sophont-made, yours to choose from.  
*Calamity*  
Required:(Shaker) Bedlam  
You become a Living Calamity. Bedlam randomly occurs in your area, while retaining all features of CF.  
(Shaker) Hazardous Disaster  
Cost: 13 SP  
Your power deals with disasters, both freakish, man-made, and natural alike, within an area of 200m² you emulate and bring forth any disaster or catastrophe that can occur within nature and/or civilization. At first, you start with low-risk disasters like Cat 1 hurricanes, 3.0 earthquakes, or possible man-made disasters if factors are present, which ramps up to high-risk or near-cataclysmic disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, thunderstorms, tornadoes, heatwaves, snowstorms, landslides, sinkholes, eruptions, droughts, firestorms, nuclear explosions, fallout, epidemics, etc. the more conflict or devastation you spread while also extending your range to 500m². You have a light control of what type of disaster you can summon depending on the meteorological and territorial features within your area, with the chance of drawing forth multiple types of disasters.  
*CF*  
Required:(Shaker) Bedlam  
Bedlam adds an element of volatility, there’s select fields of instability where reality breaks down and worsens the disaster’s havoc, causing irreparable damage to some areas, especially owing to fluctuations and deformations from it alongside the ensuing disaster dictating what flavor of unpredictability some poor sod may find. The selection method usually finds places with the most tension or conflict the most preferable.

Walking Afterlife  
Cost: 40 SP  
Required:(Trump) Faerie Queen  
Now both your Death Touch and your claiming range no longer are limited to just Parahumans. Any sentient/sapient being that dies within your range or that you use your Death Touch on will be claimed, allowing you to summon them as shades.  
You have a mental world that houses those you claimed. It changes to accommodate all within but you can freely alter it, the only limit is that you can't intentionally harm those within.  
*Usurper*  
Required: Esoteric Knowledge, or Shardless  
Your claiming range enters any afterlife connected to the universe you are in. It will gradually increase within them until it encompasses the entirety of it.  
Besides that, you can now claim the dead even when they weren't in your range when they died. As long as something of importance to them — like their house or a person they had a friendship with — or that is connected to them — like the tinkertech of a dead parahuman or the dried blood of someone whose corpse is unreachable but left a trail behind — is within your range, you can claim even those whose bodies were completely erased.  
Deeper Insight  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Trump) Faerie Queen  
Besides seeing a visual representation of someone's power and Shard you can now access and parse through all the data the Shard of a Parahuman has. This includes any and all information it has on its host.  
Using this acquired data, your own shades will slowly incorporate part of it to improve their own powers. Your power will do the same to itself.  
All of this also applies to the data the Shards of your shades has, so even without encountering any other Parahumans your Shades would still improve.  
The Wild Hunt  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Trump) Faerie Queen  
Once a month, you enter a state called The Wild Hunt where you can use all your shades at once, your shades not only use weakened versions of each other's powers but can summon and command lesser copies of your other shades, with those copies having alternate expressions instead of a copy of the powers of the originals. Essentially, your original shades are the Commanders and the lesser copies are their Subordinates.  
You can make your shades explode, any Parahuman caught in the blast radius immediately dies and is then claimed, doing so causes the shade you sacrificed to take a while to be summoned again. Sacrificing a Commander will cause all of its summoned Subordinates to also explode.  
You can control and slowly emit a black miasma that weakens those who touch it, when you are in the Wild Hunt state all your shades can emit this miasma, and the speed it appears is dramatically increased. You and those you are hunting can see through the miasma, it wouldn't exactly be a satisfying hunt if your prey can't fight back after all.  
When in your Wild Hunt state you have a need to hunt Parahumans using the full might of your Faerie Queen-related abilities.  
*Army of Death*  
Required:Death Parade  
You are now constantly in your Wild Hunt state and your need to hunt Parahumans is something you can safely ignore with ease.  
*Ankou*  
Required:(Trump) Oberon  
Your Shard creates a permanent connection with any Parahuman that enters your claiming range and will conspire to cause their death depending on your wishes. This permanent connection means they will be claimed even if they leave your claiming range.  
*Manannán mac Lir*  
Required:Pillage  
Pillage's range to claim the minds and powers of those who didn't die by your hands is now equal to that of Faerie Queen.  
When you claim a Parahuman you gain two options: You can choose all three expressions of a power resulting in you gaining three shades — each being able to use one of the three expressions — but you won't have gain the actual power of the original. Or you can choose one of the expressions and the power of the original, resulting in a single shade that can use both.  
(Trump) Faerie Queen  
Cost: 20 SP  
You have Glaistig Uaine's powerset. You can claim the powers of any Parahumans that die within your range and can kill any Parahuman by touching them or a manifestation of their power. You can summon shades of the Parahumans whose power you have claimed, these shades resemble their living form but exaggerate certain features and focus on the costumes and other things associated with their powers. You can generally have 3 or so shades active at a time, but can have more active at the cost of them being made weaker. You have a sight-based ability that lets you see images based off of the powers of other Parahumans and how they interact with the world, this gives you enough detail that you can even see trigger events in some cases. Negentropy let you summon an additional shade.  
*Ereshkigal*  
Required:(Mover/Shaker) Nexus  
When 'claiming' parahumans, your shard now takes over the entirety of the associated shard network and transfers it to your dimension instead of just a select sub-network. This means that, instead of only acquiring a specific parahuman and their direct shards, you can access their entire shard network. As such, you can generate shades of other hosts, even if they died years ago or are still living, by using the mental 'imprints' of hosts from the shard network. These shards can be accessed directly in your dimension and you can exchange energy between them to boost specific shades or recharge them.  
The shades of parahumans you produce by using their shard 'imprints' no longer fade over time, rather they retain all of their abilities, memories and intelligence as they were in life and are completely loyal to you. Your shades also no longer have any range limitations and you retain constant awareness of them, enabling you to mentally command them at any distance. You have a greatly increased number of shades that you can have active at full power at once, up to 9 total, and Negentropy will increase your maximum limit of shades by 1 every month.  
Your power sight is also far clearer, allowing you to perfectly comprehend the inner mechanisms of parahuman's shards, their history and their powers. A word of warning; claiming highly important shards will draw the attention of the Entity if they're part of its network.

Unseen Under The Mist  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:(Shaker/Stranger) The Mist of London Night  
The mist you now summon has taken on eerie properties. Everyone, with the exception of you, in the mist are affected by illusions. To every person within the fog, the world around them transforms—shadows of the long-dead flicker in the corners of their vision, and the landscape subtly reshapes itself into eerie scenes of your choosing, however you cannot alter the true nature of physical objects— a wall remains a wall, a floor stays solid beneath your feet—but within the mist, they appear transformed. You can mask reality, making a stone wall look like the decaying facade of a gothic cathedral or turn the ground into worn cobblestone streets. Whether it’s the grim, twisted streets of gothic London, a haunted forest, or an ancient battlefield, the mist bends perception to your will, overlaying its ghostly veneer onto the real world.  
But the mist's horrors run deeper than mere illusions. Should anyone perish within it, their essence is trapped, condemned to wander the fog as a ghostly wraith. These spectral prisoners are bound forever to your mist, haunting and tormenting any new intruders who dare enter. They cannot actually do anything beyond speak in pain within the fog, but they will radiate a sense of wrongness to anyone who sees them.  
*Ghost of Ones Past*  
Required:(Trump) Faerie Queen  
Anyone who dies in your mist instantly becomes one of your spectres. The bigger you mist, the more spectres you can summon, with them able to wander the entire mist freely. At the base, you can summon up to 5 spectres at once in your mist and the number will grow as the mist does. Your spectres also take on more creepy and horrifying forms when in the mist, giving off a sense of wrongness and unliving to those who see them.  
*Encroaching Fog*  
Required:Foggy Idea  
The illusions become stronger the longer people stay within your fog, reaching to the point that they can physically be harmed by them. Additionally, their sense of direction is weakened drastically, making it near impossible to leave your mist, as even teleports will likely be redirected to another part of your mist.  
(Shaker/Stranger) The Mist of London Night  
Cost: 4 SP  
You have the unique ability to generate a thick and dense fog in your surroundings. The radius of the mist gradually expands as you remain inside it, growing up to a 300-meter radius. Your presence within the mist is virtually undetectable, with only the strongest sensory abilities capable of piercing through it. You possess the remarkable ability to see perfectly through the fog, and you are even granted a strong increase in speed while inside.  
One of the unusual effects of the fog is that it emits a strange aura of obliviousness where people are unable to notice it until they are deeply engulfed. Those trapped inside the mist suffer from a lack of direction and gradual stamina drain. The strength of these effects increases as the night progresses and peaks at midnight, creating a surreal and disorienting environment.  
*Snowy Fog*  
Required:(Shaker/Stranger) The Mist of London Night \[Addon from Wittikka\]  
Your mist undergoes a transformation, merging with your wendigo form. It now radiates an intense, bone-chilling cold, causing a thin layer of frost and even snow to accumulate on everything within its reach. This mist grants you an almost omniscient awareness of all things within its bounds, allowing you to perceive every movement and detail. Moreover, the mist no longer relies on your physical presence to be sustained. The longer you maintain the mist in a specific area, the longer it can persist independently, with this duration extending even further as the mist absorbs the stamina and energy of others.

You Can’t Kill An Idea  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Memetic King  
As long as at least 100 people retain knowledge of you, true death is impossible. You are bound to the thoughts and memories of others, ensuring that you will always be reborn through those who remember you. The time it takes for your rebirth depends on the depth of their knowledge and understanding of you; those with only a vague memory of your existence will take years, while those who have studied you deeply can accelerate the process. If a person is surrounded by others who also know of you, the combined awareness speeds up your resurrection.  
Before your rebirth, the target begins to change subtly, adopting characteristics that echo your own. They may develop similar mannerisms, personality traits, or even ambitions and goals that mirror yours. Their thoughts might become more aligned with your perspective, and their desires may start to resemble those you held in life. As this transformation progresses, you gradually replace them, until finally, you return, fully reborn.  
*An Idea Is Eternal*  
Required:(Master) In Your Shadow  
Whether they are allies, enemies, or mere bystanders, anyone with knowledge of you will be influenced by your presence, each in their own way. They begin to adopt traits that resemble yours, subtly altering their behaviors, ideals, or ambitions. Should you die, you gain the choice to forego rebirth. Instead, you can channel your essence into those who remember you, amplifying the traits they’ve inherited from you. In doing so, your legacy lives on, woven into the thoughts and actions of those who carry your memory, shaping the world through their new perspectives. This effect is permanent, so as long as anyone gets information about you, even after you have truly died, traits belonging to you will begin to appear in them.  
(Master/Thinker) Memetic King  
Cost: 20 SP  
You harbor an unparalleled awareness and insight into all entities that possess knowledge of you. This ability manifests as a sixth sense that enables you to detect their presence and discern the depth and nature of the information they hold about you. You can subtly manipulate those who are privy to your existence, as the number and specificity of those who know you dictate the extent of your control. Once at least 200 individuals possess knowledge of you, you can possess one person to act on your behalf for 10 minutes. Upon surpassing 500 individuals possessing knowledge of you, you are capable of possessing three individuals simultaneously for 1 hour. With more than 1000 individuals possessing knowledge of you, you can possess 10 people simultaneously indefinitely, with this cap increasing with further exposure. Your capacity to multitask scales with the number of individuals you can possess.

Money Grows On Trees  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:Gibbet  
You can now automate the process. By pushing an object into the ground, you can choose to create a “tree”. The tree’s appearance is based on the object. The tree will passively grow the object, creating duplicates constantly. The more complex the object, like tinkertech, the longer it takes to grow, with the longest being 1 item per day. The only limitation is that you have to be able to lift the object you are trying to make a tree for.  
Gibbet  
Cost: 8 SP  
You have a Shaker ability, letting you spawn countless copies of objects that you push into the ground. These require your presence and attention to exist. These objects lurch and spear out of the ground. You can replicate almost anything in an area, with the replications independent of the template after replication.

Interactable  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Striker) Grippy Grip  
Your ability to grip things has expanded into the power to treat any substance or physically present phenomena as if it was a solid object with a consistency of your choice. This allows you to bend and mold phenomena as you see fit. Walk on fire, throw lightning, and bend light. This does not extend to more exotic and non-physical phenomena such as Master powers or Vista’s space warping.  
(Striker) Grippy Grip  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can grab and hold onto anything. You can grab lasers and throw them back, explosions and redirect them, and you can even grab entire buildings if you are strong enough. You gain 15x faster reaction speed and anything you catch cannot harm you or escape your grip unless you want it to. This can negate teleportation as well.

Antimemetic Sinkhole  
Cost: 13 SP  
Required:(Stranger) Shroud  
Your Shroud developed much further regarding his obscuring methods to its logical extreme, essentially gaining an All-or-Nothing effect changing you into an antimemetic existence, an idea or entity with self-censoring properties, not shrouding any shred of information so much as never leaving any sign of you. Consisting in a Shrouding Breaker effect, it shifts your physical self out of reality, maintaining one’s self-existence or definition while erasing from the rest of the world. As an antimeme, this leaves you an informational black hole, devouring any information about yourself, from their physical presence, becoming virtually intangible and undetectable, up to mental presence, redacting others’ memories and one’s historical records.  
*You Don’t Recognize The Thing You Just Saw*  
Required:Cask of Amontillado  
Your trap setting has integrated into your antimemetic power enveloping anything under an antimemetic field, making it impossible for the victim/object/area, and anything done by/within the victim/object/area, to be perceived or remembered. This Veil then, if the target is a conscious entity, consumes their memories and knowledge, effectively accelerating neurodegeneration. Others outside the field can’t sense the Veil and find their thoughts over this oddity drained out of them.  
(Stranger) Shroud  
Cost: 30 SP  
You can become completely undetectable both from a conventional and parahuman standpoint. This power comes from an endeavor to refine and specialize a Cloak Shard toward survivorship through imperceptibility from other Entities while being a culmination of different Stranger Shards into one. Being selectively customizable to your needs or concerns, the methods can vary according to one’s environment and opposition.  
From a standard perspective, anyone is unable to perceive or recognize you in any shape or form, on a physical aspect, your power shrouds you off the electromagnetic spectrum turning translucently invisible, subtly canceling vibrations in your vicinity turning you inaudible, masking your scent to blend with the environment, dispersing your temperature signature, retroactively modifying any existent records or media as if you never appeared, your physical presence is essentially muted to the point of turning you selectively intangible; mental aspects such as using perceptive amnesia, distorting anyone’s memories, awareness and perceptions as to obscure your profile or mislead them to cover-up your intentions or actions; this can be used offensively for surprise and unperceivable attacks in combat situations.  
From a parahuman perspective, Thinker powers enhancing and expanding the sensorial and intellectual range find themselves struck out from the power’s concealment, effectively removing you from their sights as if you weren’t there to begin with. Thinker powers based on simulating, data crunching, postcognition, pericognition, and precognition come up blank when assessing you, selectively obscuring aspects of yourself to either be a non-person to their powers or simply unsuspecting, effectively employing antimemetic mechanics.  
The parahuman aspect is adaptive, appraising the probable vulnerability in the face of detection and responding accordingly.  
This is feasibly regarded as the epitome of Stranger powers, with their mechanics using multiple methods of stealth, from physics to multi-dimensional exploitation to camouflage. Despite all this, the weaknesses you’ll encounter are Endbringers and Entities, which come from circumventing your abilities through the Cycle’s rules.  
*Enshroud*  
Required:Cask of Amontillado  
Your ability to hide traps has been integrated into Shroud, allowing you to make any object you have touched covered by your shroud. This allows you to prevent any important documents, stashes of money, or your hard drive of homework from being detected by anything weaker than the shroud itself. Your shroud will also adapt to the object in question, allowing it to do things such as deflect sub-routines for files, encrypted and hidden from forensics; obfuscate and misdirect fields for large or group of objects; remove scents and so on. It is also possible to indirectly shroud others if they are in contact with one of these items. You can revoke this at any time.

Heavy Weather  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:(Shaker) Storm  
Your weather control has gained a significant power boost, increasing its range by about 20% as well as the maximum intensity of weather you can manifest: Where originally you could create weather at the peak of what was possible on earth, you could now create phenomena like rainfall so thick it turns roads into rivers, blizzards that can bury entire towns, thunderstorms strong enough to fry entire power grids, or artificial heat waves hot enough to burn forests or melt asphalt.  
Wild Weather  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:(Shaker) Storm  
Your weather control has been greatly broadened, allowing you to generate highly unnatural weather and even some more exotic meteorological phenomena: Some examples of new "storms" include snowing radioactive ash, raining blood, frogs, acid or actual fire in the form of embers/sparks, or even forming disorienting/hallucinogenic auroras.  
(Shaker) Storm  
Cost: 12 SP  
You can control the weather within 1000 miles of your location. Your precision on a small scale is not nearly as precise as that of an Airbender, but you can do powerful airblasts. You can form tornadoes or hurricanes on a whim. You could easily destroy society by yourself, but the only thing you could do against an Endbringer is make it sunny, which would stop Leviathan from using the rain. Otherwise, this power is useless against the Endbringers.

Elysian Seed  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Trump) Power Seed  
The power seeds that you create have their 15 SP cap increased to 25 SP, after which it’ll continue to grow as it normally would.  
You can increase their rate of growth till their natural SP cap by reducing their overall potential; each SP it’s reduced by doubling the speed of growth.  
Your ability to recall gifted powers has been enhanced to allow you to allocate them as you will, whether to yourself, others, or even back to the original recipient. additionally you are now able to use all powers at 100%  
*Garden of Elysium*  
Required:(Trump) Cultivation  
Required:Power Cultivator  
Your ability to create power seeds has mutated horizontally, allowing you to imbue almost anything with a power seed. While your power seed can be imbued into almost anything, it’s gained two new particular power vectors for its abilities.

First is seeding, through which you generate an actual plant seed from any part of your body. This plant seed can be of any type of plant that you know of, have ever touched, seen, or otherwise encountered in any manner. You can manifest as many of these plant seeds as you wish, in any variety of combinations allowing you to create a veritable garden.

The plant seed will grow a power imbued into it throughout its maturation, at the end when it reaches maturity and starts producing fruit or vegetables of its own, which can be eaten to give its consumers fantastical abilities. Moreover, continued cultivation of further generations of the same foods can empower the abilities even further.  
You can choose to cross-breed across different power seeds offspring to try to produce different expressions or fusions, perhaps even generate entirely new abilities with enough breeding.  
The plant will cultivate the power it is imbued with at the same rate as you normally would, you can also amplify it as normal, and direct effort to cultivate the plant will increase its overall potential by half. You can also choose to imbue weaknesses into the power such as removing the consumer’s ability to swim to increase its potential by half again.

When the seed is created you may opt to choose the theme it will produce, you can then choose whether the plant will produce the same power for every piece of produce, or if it’ll cultivate a different expression for every piece of produce, or some mix of the two at a ratio of your choice.  
You can re-elect this option again for every subsequent generation, allowing you to imbue randomness or keep it predictable for every generation. You can also choose whether the seed will focus on horizontal or vertical upgrades for the power for every generation after the first or some mix of both. You can also choose what theme the power will focus on for each generation, or whether you simply want it to focus on its existing one, however, this will not produce a new power but merely help direct the theme of the new generation’s alterations to its existing power. You may also choose to leave the theme entirely random. You may let random evolution play a part as well, allowing some products to be better producing greater powers while others produce weaker ones.  
You can opt for the seedling to show some signs of its unique nature in its physical form, such as Fruit that seems to be covered in swirls and marks denoting it power giving nature, or perhaps a tree with bark that looks like ash and leaves that are always orange and almost like their on fire in the right angle, although they’re mostly cosmetic changes. The produce provided may also have some hints of the powers it grants through its taste.

Without your direct hand in its cultivation, subsequent generations will generally stick to the same theme as previous generations. You can also choose to just have the generations produce the same product over and over again, with minor mutations changing over time but no faster than normal mutations through evolution.  
Power generated through these kinds of seeds is unable to be recalled at will, but you can partake in their consumption to obtain their benefits like anyone else. Anyone may eat as many as they please, granting the potential for you as well as others to harbor multiple powers. You can choose to restrict this to particular species lest unwanted pests start to develop abilities.  
The second ability granted to you is the ability to imbue your seeds into existing life, such as animals for a similar effect as you would on humans.  
*Garden of Cultivation*  
Required:Power Cultivator  
Your innate ability to cultivate alongside your higher quality seeds has amplified your ability to plant and grow powers.  
The first benefit is that your seeds will now grow at a rate of 3 SP a week till it reaches 30 SP where it becomes mature. Your boosting ability is similarly amplified, now the powers your boosting improve at a rate of 3 SP to a maximum of triple the SP of the original power.  
The second benefit is that you can now imbue multiple seeds into someone at the same time, however each seed must be at a different level of potential from one another.  
If you possess Hecantocheires you can imbue any amount of seeds of the same potential into someone. Be wary however as unless you’re Shardless or possess Negentropy, this possesses the capability to quickly drain your shard dry.  
(Trump) Power Seed  
Cost: 15 SP  
You may give someone a random 1 SP power with a theme of your choice that will grow with them at a rate of 1 SP/week. It will grow based on their actions and experiences, and will try to suit their needs similar to Dynamist Jr. When a seed hits 15 SP, it is no longer budding and it is now mature. When a seed matures, then it will stop growing at an enhanced rate, but it will continue to grow and adapt forever as if it were shardless. You may plant these seeds on an unlimited number of people, but a single person can only have one budding seed at a time. At any point you may choose to take the power back, though it will lose its enhanced growth rate as if it is mature. You may have any number of these powers active at 50% power, but only one at 100%.  
*Golden Seed*  
Required:(Trump) Cultivation  
You can cultivate powers granted through power seed, increasing their growth speed depending on how much time you devote to cultivating them, up to a maximum of three times their normal growth speed. You can also use this to manually direct their growth, allowing you to gradually tweak them to your liking during their growth phase.

Sure Critical Hit  
Cost: 11 SP  
Required:(Blaster/Striker) Sneak Attack  
If your target is unaware of your attack, this could be as simple as not seeing it, it will bypass all defenses—no matter how powerful or esoteric they are—ensuring the strike lands and deals damage with absolute certainty.  
Bonus damage from these sneak attacks starts with a 2x multiplier and continues stacking with each successful unnoticed hit. The stacking bonus resets if the target dies or if you switch to a different target.  
(Blaster/Striker) Sneak Attack  
Cost: 4 SP  
Unseen attacks from you deal twice the damage they normally would. This can apply to any form of attack so long as they are not aware of its existence.

King Crimson  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Glimpse  
Fate may be absolute, but your powers have evolved beyond merely glimpsing its path. Now, not only can you peer up to 10 seconds into the future, you can also leap over its inevitable consequences.  
Your new ability allows you to erase a given frame of time, from the moment you activate your power, up to 10 seconds ahead. During this erased span, you alone remain conscious, free to adjust your actions while the world around you carries on, unaware of the lost time. When the ability ends, no one but you retains any memory of what occurred during that period.  
Simply put, your Time Erasure eliminates the cause, but the effect persists.  
While time is erased, you become completely intangible—invulnerable to any physical attack. However, this also means you can't interact with anyone while the ability is still active. You can still interact with objects already connected to your body, you can for example splatter your blood onto an enemy's projection in anticipation of blinding them, etc.  
Furthermore, actions you would have performed during the erased time still come to pass, even though you didn’t actually execute them. For example, if you intended to pick up a bottle of water in the next 2 seconds but skipped over that duration, you would still find it in your hand when time resumes.  
(Thinker) Glimpse  
Cost: 10 SP  
You constantly see 10 seconds into the future. You also possess a secondary multi-tasking thinker ability that allows your perception to seamlessly process both your normal vision and your future sight at the same time, ensuring this duality doesn’t interfere with the natural flow of your body’s movements or actions.  
You can turn this vision off at will, but it'll turn back on if you're going to get seriously injured within the next ten seconds.

Manipulator  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Plans within Plans  
Your ability to create plans has been comprehensively upgraded. You gain a subspecialty in creating non-linear plans which arrange countless events in order to create a general 'trend' that favors your goals. Even if one specific plot fails, your overall situation is hardly impacted and your failure is covered by countless subplans. Due to your careful planning, you will usually gain something regardless of the outcome of an event.  
This subspecialty is further supported by a boost to your planning capabilities. Your plans now border on precognition, and you can set long chains of events in motion with a single inconspicuous action. This can lead to countless "coincidences" and "reasonable developments" which continuously favor you and your goals. However, some individuals may notice the repeated coincidences and realize they are being manipulated.  
Your plans also have a larger scope. If you focus your efforts on a single city, you can establish control with ease, setting up major events which benefit your goals without anyone even noticing your manipulations. You can chain several of these plans together to completely dominate the trend of the times. This is massively increased in both potency and scope if you have an actual precog power or with an allied precog.  
(Thinker) Plans within Plans  
Cost: 12 SP  
You are amazing at making plans. However, the longer term and more complicated the plan you want to make, the longer it takes to make the plan. If your plan is going to take a whole century to complete, or is very complicated, it might take years for you to complete your plan. A somewhat complex plan that lasts a week will only take a couple of hours. This power does not make you OCD.  
*I Love it When a Plan Comes Together*  
Required: Thinker/Trump (Dare to be Stupid), or (Tinker) Absurdity  
"Give me a minute, I'm good. If I've got an hour, I'm great. You give me six months? I'm unbeatable."  
You have the strategic and sometimes unorthodox ability and resourcefulness of John "Hannibal" Smith, leader of the A-Team. You can adapt to any situation and free yourself from dangers by using what is available to you. Just like Hannibal, you nearly always have an equally crazy and brilliant plan that gets the goals of the mission done.

Dividend  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:(Striker) Divide  
Your ability to halve things expands, allowing you to apply the lost halve of whatever you affected to yourself or anything you are touching. This will always work from a perspective, so in specific scenarios it can affect things other than yourself, like halving the sharpness of the target's sword, which can transfer that lost sharpness to your own if you also touch another blade. This can be applied to anything you can imagine working on, like taking half of your opponent’s physical strength, taking half of their height, or even more esoteric applications like taking half of their power’s range or half of their luck.  
(Striker) Divide  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can "halve" anything with a touch. The bigger the physical object, the longer it takes (it scales progressively). Objects always get halved at exactly 50% of their mass. You have some control over how and where objects get halved. You can halve anything weighing a couple of kilograms instantly. You can also halve imaginary "concepts" or forces that affect objects and people, such as "This object's drag is only half" or "This person only uses half of their stamina when moving." They can have 2–5 ongoing halvings at a time. The more specific and limited the halving, the easier it is to maintain.  
*Recursive Dividing*  
Required:(Trump) Permanent Effect  
Permanent Effect removes your limited number of ongoing halving with it becoming a permanent part of reality while also allowing you to stack the effect halving anything again, again, again…

Four-leaf Clover  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Shamrock  
Instead of being limited to just micro-telekinesis, your powers now operate through a vast range of micro-Shaker effects; manipulating the laws of physics in your favour. For example, these tiny Shaker effects could include adjusting gravity, manipulating electromagnetic energy, influencing chemical reactions or even minuscule spatial-temporal effects.  
Furthermore, you've also acquired an incredibly subtle micro-Master effect component to your power, allowing you to ever-so-slightly influence the thoughts and emotions of yourself and others within your range. Any 'alterations' done by these effects, both Master and Shaker, are practically imperceptible although these slight changes will subsequently lead to greater, noticeably beneficial outcomes i.e. appearing as incredible 'luck'.  
Practically speaking, this significantly expands the situations in which your 'luck' appears. For instance, your powers could adjust the electricity within a slot machine for you to win big while also implementing a very subtle Master effect on the casino staff, influencing their thoughts to overlook any suspicions.  
Shamrock  
Cost: 6 SP  
You possess a subtle combination of micro-telekinesis combined with an unconscious small-scale clairvoyance/precognition-based Thinker ability. You can cause slight changes around you which lead to greater effects, manipulating events in your favour and so giving the appearance of extraordinary luck.  
For example, you could shoot with perfect accuracy, casually dodge attacks, influence dice rolls or easily find lost objects. Your powers also cause you to be a Thinker blindspot to most.  
*Luck of the Irish*  
Required:(Shaker) Deus Ex Machina  
The scope and potency of what Shamrock can do has been considerably amplified. Your unconscious clairvoyance and precognition abilities now encompass an entire city with your precognition able to see up to 24 hours into the future. Your micro-telekinesis has similarly benefited from this new range, with Shamrock working subconsciously to continuously cause slight changes to your future benefit.  
Your 'luck' has magnified exponentially as Shamrock and Deus Ex Machina play off each other to create powerful, cascading chain reactions on a grand scale. A series of seemingly unrelated malfunctions across the city could occur to prevent enemy reinforcements or a building might collapse on an opponent due to structural weaknesses having 'spontaneously' transpired hours earlier.

Valiant  
Cost: 14 SP  
Required: Dean Stansfield, or Gallant  
You passively collect and store emotional energy from everything within a 100 ft radius around you that can be used to greatly empower your blasts and emotional abilities.  
The degree of the boost depends on the number of emotions you are using as well as their potency. Different emotions can also provide new and varied effects that you can discover with practice, different emotions mixing at varying levels producing different effects, almost like an alchemical mixture.  
A mother’s anger and frustration at a misbehaving child at a supermarket may empower a concussive blast that would normally have left a dent in a midsize sedan to instead pulverize the vehicle outright while scorching the surroundings.  
A grief stricken widow may allow your blasts to enforce a feeling of helplessness or panic within a large radius of where your blast hits, eating away at the targeted site like acid while cratering the ground whereas before it may have only knocked back an assailant a few feet.  
Freshly triggered capes tend to produce a massive amount of potent energy and emotion for your use.  
You can also collect and store the emotional energy of anything hit by blasts, even outside your range, and will actively feed on any emotions produced as a result of your actions.  
While you passively collect and store energy, this effect has no impact on those in range, unless you actively choose to amplify the effect in which case you can choose to rapidly drain the emotions of everything in range inducing an incredibly powerful feeling of apathy, nihilism, and listlessness, eventually people just stop moving and staring into space.  
You can also target this effect at specific people instead of leaving it as blind effect.  
Your thinker ability is also amplified, capable of intuitively understanding the emotions of others and the context of them.  
With minor effort this can be used to accurately interpret their thoughts and actions rather than the heavy guesswork required before.  
Your blasts are also noticeably more powerful, able to fling a car without amplification or much effort.  
The emotional energy stored can also be used to amplify the user as well as any other powers they possess, however it’ll take practice to discover the specifics of what produces what.  
You can also directly project emotion, stored or otherwise, upon anyone in your range, without having to imbue it into your blasts.  
Your power can, and automatically will, store and use your own emotional energy the same as anyone else’s.

Immortal Godly Demonic Jade Emperor Chant of the Seven Heavenly Providence Divine Samsara Buddha of 1000 Virtues and Sins™  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Trump) Warcry  
Through the use of chants and exaggerated gestures, you can dramatically enhance any ability or skill you possess. The longer and more exaggerated the chant and performance, the greater the boost. For example, if you're solving math problems, delivering a grand, over-the-top chant while striking dynamic poses will amplify your calculative abilities to an extraordinary level, allowing you to process complex equations with superhuman speed and precision. There is no limit to how strong it can get, just how long of a chant you can say and how much you can exaggerate your gestures.  
AAAARRRRGGGHHH\!\!\!  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Trump) Warcry  
You have unlocked your inner barbarian—your powers now surge with the sheer volume and passion of your shout. By roaring your intent, you amplify both control and strength, each word shaping the effect based on your action. A powerful yell like “Crush\!” intensifies your physical force, while a fierce “Pierce\!” hones precision and focus. The louder and more passionately you shout, the greater the boost, making your powers sharper, stronger, and more focused. Longer, more detailed warcries create complex effects, such as “Shield against all harm\!” to reinforce your defenses. You can also get more basic, giving a raw, general increase simply by wordlessly screaming.  
(Trump) Warcry  
Cost: 7 SP  
By explaining your current action, you get much stronger. Your powers will express themselves in a more controllable and powerful manner. The longer the chant more accurately defines it, the greater it expresses itself.

Out Of Bounds  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:(Breaker/Shaker) Bugged Out  
You now possess the ability to locate and phase into “Out of Bounds” areas—those hidden, non-existent spaces that lie beyond the intended boundaries of the world. These areas are normally inaccessible, but you can slip into them at will as long as you reach an entrance. Once inside an Out of Bounds area, the rules of reality break down, allowing you to traverse great distances, bypass obstacles, or remain undetected by enemies. These spaces can also act as secret caches, where you can store items or trap foes in a place where they can’t escape. These spaces are blind spots for average shards, Endbringers and Entities can find them, even access them depending on their powers.  
(Breaker/Shaker) Bugged Out  
Cost: 13 SP  
You can see “flaws” in the world. Through these flaws, you can break reality in beneficial ways. Glitching through walls, cloning objects, and teleportation, all of this is possible as long as you can find the right spots and learn the right methods. You instinctively know how to use each flaw you find, although it may take some time to master.  
*Bethesda*  
Required:Dovahkiin (TES)  
You now possess the physics of a Bethesda game character, allowing you to perform ridiculous feats such as launching people into the sky at mach speeds, making your horse fly, item duping, terrain clipping, sequence breaks, and a whole host of other ridiculous feats.  
*Collision Glitch*  
Required:(Mover/Shaker) Move Cancel  
Your Move Cancel is subsumed into Bugged Out, incorporating better uses and advancements in “flaws” in movement and collision detection. You exploit the collision detection of a bus or any other object by running into it launching it, infusing a “flaw” in collision detection onto other objects or weapons, phasing your attacks into the other side, infinite jumping by “false” ground (which is also exploitable), the vaunted BLJ, lag exploits, or any movement exploits to date and thought of.  
*Hyper Armor*  
Required:(Brute) Immunity Frames  
You can apply a “flaw” on how you give and take damage, every attack you do can tank 2 hits or offensive without being staggered or losing your stance until your poise breaks afterward, your movement has a passive Super Armor where you any damage you endure is reduced between 5%-20% without any pushback or breaking stride, with the chance of invincibility frames in case of recovering from unconsciousness.  
*Game-breaking Glitch*  
Required:(Shaker) Bedlam  
Your “flaws” are now out of your control, unbidden from yourself aside from an “on-and-off” switch. This results in unintended consequences like people being caught on “fault” on the ground, finding themselves falling from the first floor of their apartment, and simply anything from your proximity irremediably twisted and broken beyond belief.

Sovereign  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Master/Shaker) Goddess  
Your connection to the shards making up Goddesses's cluster has reached its maximum potential, greatly enhancing all your powers and resulting in unrivalled pre-eminence.  
Your Master power now affects anyone, not just Parahumans, continuously aligning their cognition into being subservient to you when in your presence. The telekinetic power you possess has had its Manton Limits removed, allowing you to affect organic matter with the same ease as inorganic material and you can now toss buildings the size of skyscrapers.

Your Trump ability to automatically tune your personal defences is now instantaneous and provides you with a perfect, nigh-absolute defence or immunity against any threat. It still can only tune to negate a single threat, power or effect at a time but you can prioritise which danger to tune to. To complement this ability, your danger sense provides far more detailed information about threats than before, conveying their precise nature, source, strength and timing. You can sense indirect, non-immediate threats such as traps and accurately predict attacks up to an hour into the future.  
Your fifth power, your personal power battery, holds significantly more energy and can recharge faster, allowing you to maintain enhanced abilities for longer periods. You can strengthen multiple powers at once although this will quickly drain your battery depending on the level of boosts provided. Finally, your last power has also improved in strength to now be on par with a low Tier 2 power.  
(Master/Shaker) Goddess  
Cost: 17 SP  
You have six powers:  
Your primary power is a Master power that lets you influence anyone in your vicinity, which realigns parahuman cognition into being your subjects.  
The second power is telekinesis; as a powerful long-range expression of this ability you can fly, have super-strength, and manipulate objects and people. Your telekinesis manifests as fractal patterns in the air, and although you are only capable of moving inorganic objects, you are capable of seizing people by their clothes.  
Third, you have a touch-based Trump ability that lets you tune abilities and defenses in a manner akin to Scion.  
Fourth, you have a danger sense. Your danger sense will alert you to the strength and direction of any danger that you face. If the danger is overwhelming, such as in the case of Scion or Contessa, you will feel danger with a distinct lack of direction.  
Fifth, you have a personal power battery that you can tap to strengthen your abilities for limited amounts of time. When used in conjunction with your Master ability, the influence can spread between capes like a virus.  
The sixth power is unknown. You may freely decide what it is so long as it's no stronger than high Tier 1\.

That’s Hell You Are Walking Into  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Master/Mover) Hell on Earth  
Whenever you send someone into the testing world, time and reality warp around them, causing their minds to twist and their bodies to mutate. Within this hellish realm, they undergo a grotesque transformation that leaves them nearly unrecognizable—another monster among the horrific inhabitants of this world. This process of transformation takes precisely 6 days, 6 minutes, and 6 seconds.

During this time, their mental state deteriorates under the relentless torment and warped reality, while their physical form becomes increasingly monstrous, adapted to survive the harsh environment. Once the transformation is complete, you gain their loyalty, and they can be summoned as part of your power.  
However, if you choose to bring someone out of the testing world before the transformation process is complete, they will still have undergone significant warping, but they may retain some semblance of their former humanity. These individuals will not be loyal to you, as their time in the world has not fully bound them to your will.  
You have the option to exempt certain individuals from this effect.  
Gates Of Hell  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Master/Mover) Hell on Earth  
All Parahumans in the testing world now gain a new passive ability when summoned: a thematic shaker effect. This power reshapes the environment around them to reflect their personal theme, which is influenced equally by their core abilities and the nature of their trigger event.  
For instance, a parahuman whose trigger event was tied to decay might find their surroundings crumbling and eroding, causing structures to deteriorate and the ground to become unstable. Conversely, a parahuman with a theme of fire might see the environment perpetually scorched, with flames and unstable terrain creating hazardous conditions. If a parahuman's trigger event occurred in a hospital, their thematic shaker effect could reflect the trauma and distress of that experience, causing the environment to become a nightmarish version of a hospital, with decrepit, blood-stained rooms, flickering lights, and unsettling medical equipment.  
This alteration enhances each parahuman’s capabilities and modifies the environment to align with their powers and experiences. The result is an ever-evolving, dangerous landscape where the environment continuously adapts to reflect the nature of its inhabitants. You also gain an increase in the number of summons you can have at once, now being three (five with negentropy).  
Note that not all parahumans you can summon play nice with each other, at least half cause the trigger event of the other half after all.  
(Master/Mover) Hell on Earth  
Cost: 20 SP  
You gain access to a testing world for the shards, a hellish landscape covered by an eternal fog. This world serves as a brutal testing ground where experiments are conducted by the shards, often leaving the environment scarred and warped. Within this world reside parahumans, or what can barely be considered parahumans, twisted so greatly by their trigger events that they have become monstrous in both form and mind. Many have lost their human appearance entirely, while others only vaguely resemble their former selves, their grotesque mutations making them more beast than human. Over time, the extreme conditions have forced the few non-parahumans to evolve into far stronger variants of themselves. Through your connection to this world, you have two powerful abilities.  
First, you can summon any parahuman from this world to aid you. Your power helps you select the most suitable parahuman for your needs, presenting you with a list of potential candidates, each with their specific abilities and characteristics. These summoned beings are loyal to you and will follow your orders, but will still retain their monstrous tendencies. The strongest being that you can summon is around canon start Eidolon level. You can summon no more than one at a time (three with Negentropy).  
Second, you can trap anyone into this hellish world. To do so, all you need to do is touch them. Once trapped, they are subjected to the same harsh conditions and relentless torment that have shaped the current inhabitants. This can be a fate worse than death, as the eternal fog and constant threat of attack from monstrous parahumans ensure that escape is nearly impossible. Additionally, you possess constant omniscience regarding those you have sent to this world. This means you have an unerring awareness of their status, actions, and location at all times. If you wish, you can bring them back from the testing world at any moment.  
*Depths Of Hell*  
Required:(Trump) Faerie Queen  
(Trump) Faerie Queen has interacted with your power, granting you access to any parahumans who died in the testing world, including those you send there. You can now summon any of your parahumans as Shades. The benefits of Shades include their effective immortality and absolute loyalty, but they are limited to your immediate area.  
Additionally, you can choose to summon any Shade as a monstrous parahuman. This form gives them some independence and allows them to operate far from you, but with the drawbacks of limited control and the risk of their death.  
The amount of Shades and Monstrous Parahumans you can summon at once does not change.  
*Heart of Hell*  
Required: (Changer) The End-Becomer, or (Master) Bringer of the End  
Through you, your Endbringer or Endbringer-Form has established a connection to the testing world. From this link, it has gained the power of the core entity of the testing world, an Endbringer-like being that manages the experiments of the shards in their absence, manifesting as an ever-present fog. Typically passive, this entity works only to prevent the world from collapsing, ensuring the experiments continue uninterrupted.  
Empowered by this connection, your Endbringer or Endbringer-Form can now transform into a fog that can freely teleport people within it. Wherever they appear, a smaller fog acts as a gate. They can use this as a weapon by shredding anyone in the fog, simply by teleporting different pieces of them to different locations.  
Additionally, your Endbringer or Endbringer-Form gains a potent master power within its fog. This power amplifies the trauma of a target’s trigger event, forcing them to relive increasingly horrific versions of said event. It will also induce vivid, horrifying hallucinations that draw upon the deepest fears and regrets of those within it. At times, these nightmares also take the form as tangible constructs from the memories and fears of those trapped within it.  
Lastly, through your connection to this entity, you can also control the version staying within the testing world, allowing you even greater control over the world. You can also use this control to have your Endbringer or Endbringer-Form’s fog directly teleport people into the testing world.  
If you have Kaleidoscopic Hells, you or your Endbringer can also access alternate versions of these powers, such as a fog of flame and ash, as long as it’s overall equal or weaker in strength.  
*Kaleidoscopic Hells*  
Required:(Thinker/Breaker) For The Want Of A Nail  
Your access has reached even further. You can now view alternate realities of these testing worlds, where different types of tests and results have emerged. Through this, you can summon alternate versions of your original roster of parahumans, each with unique abilities and characteristics based on the variations in their testing environments and the conditions they experienced.  
For example, a testing world that is an infernal landscape of perpetual fire and brimstone. Or a gravity-altered testing world that alters the way humans evolve. Another possible testing world where all humans are under mind control to be constantly happy and content even as their bodies perish. There could even be a testing world where shards have insects trigger instead.  
Each version of the Testing world is as hellish as the last, if not more so. Some may even be completely dead as experiments could have gone overboard.  
Whenever you choose to banish people into testing worlds, you can choose which of the many worlds you have access to that you want them to go into.

The Gibborim Knight  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Chevalier  
You can use more abstract properties in your combinations. An example would be taking “explosivity” from fire to create a bomb. Your resulting creations are also more resilient and powerful while requiring less stamina and concentration. You also now exist in multiple dimensions at once giving you a minor brute rating and the ability to affect other multi-dimensional objects.  
Chevalier  
Cost: 5 SP  
You have the power to combine the properties of several items into one \- selectively taking their attributes into his primary weapons, you need stamina and concentration to use this power. These different attributes appear as shapes and lines in an abstract representation of the object's properties. You can see glimmers and images that represent the powers of others.

Combo Combo Combo  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:(Striker) Combo  
The effects of your power can now be extended to your non-melee attacks. You can eliminate or minimise the knockback effect of your attacks, channeling the force to amplify your attack’s impact and speed. This adjustment keeps your opponent from being pushed back, allowing you to stay close and deliver a relentless series of blows without interruption. With each successful hit, your attacks become progressively stronger and faster. On the final hit of your combo, all the accumulated knockback from your previous strikes will be unleashed, launching your opponent with tremendous force.  
(Striker) Combo  
Cost: 9 SP  
Your melee attacks get stronger in a geometric progression the longer you attack the same target without stopping. You have to continue hitting your opponent with pauses no longer than 5 seconds between the strikes or your combo will be broken.

Cask of Amontillado  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:(Stranger) Magician  
Your ability to surprise anyone has gone in an interesting direction. You now can fool anyone into getting into even the most obvious of traps. Have a cop fall down an open manhole, have a person stand right underneath that anvil, or just ask your annoying neighbor to try on these handcuffs. They won't realize the deception until the trap has actually sprung. This doesn't enhance the trap in any way. A brute in handcuffs isn't going to stay in handcuffs for long. Either way it happens, your victim will certainly be surprised that they actually fell for that.  
(Stranger) Magician  
Cost: 7 SP  
You are a master of surprise. Whatever you do, people will not expect it unless you allow them to. Thinkers are immune. People will be able to track your movements. Subthinkers are not immune.

Group Finder  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Looking for More  
Your mental compass evolved into a full-blown catalogue with every creature on the planet closest to you. This catalogue also has a search engine included, which allows you to filter for any combination of traits, skills, and powers that can also interpret your thoughts to the point where you could filter even for being similar to a mental image you have.  
The tracking capability of the power also improved into a mental GPS, which loads the environmental data from your own memories, making it more detailed and precise in areas you are accustomed to.  
This will also heavily synergize with any other thinker powers, as they gain access to all data in the catalogue, even for creatures you didn’t actively memorise or look up.  
*Pre-Loaded Catalogue*  
Required:(Thinker) Precognition  
Your mental catalogue feeds on the data you receive with every use of your precognition, filling out with people from the future, allowing you to search and filter for possible traits, skills, and powers within the seen future. This will also reduce the cooldown of Precognition in cases where there is a lot of overlap in the future, as the Group Finder acts as a database for every creature filling out previously obtained unchanged data.  
(Thinker) Looking for More  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can think of a set of traits and/or skills you want in somebody, and your power will give you a mental compass to the closest target fitting your criteria.

Don't Speak Her Name\!  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Stranger/Thinker) Taboo  
Your awareness over information regarding yourself has grown.  
When someone directly thinks of your name, you are immediately aware of who it was, their exact location and the context of their thoughts. Furthermore, you will be able to directly read their mind for the next 20 seconds after they think of you. This can even work with something like your organization's name, assuming you are the leader, founder, or in an authoritative position. If someone thinks of you but avoids names of anything related to you, you instead gain a vague understanding of their location and the context.  
If someone directly speaks your name out loud, you are aware of them, their location, what is being said, and who it is being said to, including the exact context. You can leverage this connection to express any of your powers within a 20 meter radius of the person, for the next 20 seconds. You can selectively "bookmark" specific individuals, contexts, or phrases. This will "ping" you mentally whenever they trigger this ability.  
The target doesn't have to think or speak your actual name: a cape name, nickname, or titles which specifically refer to you work just fine, as long as either you or the speaker associates those titles with specifically yourself. Even nicknames or pseudonyms for your organization will be picked up. However, your true name is more "clear", and speaking it will allow your gaze to penetrate memetic defenses, concealment/stranger abilities, and even temporal anomalies like rewinding time. General references such as 'She' and 'His' which can apply to a multitude of people won't get your attention even if they refer to you.  
(Stranger/Thinker) Taboo  
Cost: 7 SP  
You are aware of whenever someone is speaking about you and have a rough idea about what they are saying and where they are. This is entirely a background process and will not inconvenience you or interfere with your life. This ability is Multiversal in range but not Omniversal, you will not be made aware of discussions about your doppelgängers.

Nat 20  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Striker/Trump) Critical Hit\!  
Your powers can now land critical effectiveness as well\! In other words, if your power crits then it will be more potent. Double your strength temporarily and land a critical? Now you are quadruple as strong\! You still have the same odds as before. The time it takes for the critical to go away is dependent on what it crits, but it won't exceed 15 seconds. This does not apply to passive abilities.  
Feat: Lucky  
Cost: 1 SP  
Required:(Striker/Trump) Critical Hit\!  
You have obtained 3 Luck Points. You can spend a lucky point to reroll a critical hit, and can choose which result you want. You have a pseudo thinker ability that allows you to instantly decide if you should reroll, or if you want to choose a previous result. Your Luck Points are refreshed back to 3 after 24 hours have passed.  
*Inspiration*  
Required:Nat 20  
You aren't limited to just rerolling crits anymore, you can reroll any result that relies on luck.  
Critically critical\!  
Cost: 1 SP  
Required:(Striker/Trump) Critical Hit\!  
Your criticals can land criticals\! The odds are the same as before.  
(Striker/Trump) Critical Hit\!  
Cost: 2 SP  
You can now land Critical strikes, doing massive damage\! The damage varies depending on your luck. You have a 20% chance to do double damage, 3% to triple, 1.5% to quadruple, and 0.5% to do 10 times. If you haven't landed a critical hit after 10 hits, the next one will be. Pity critical if you will. Only a double damage critical though.  
All forms of attack qualify for critical strikes.

Destruction Barbie  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required: Victoria Dallon, Glory Girl, Antares, or (Brute) Telekinetic Barrier  
Your physical abilities have been altered, becoming a true brute instead of just emulating one through your Forcefield. Your natural durability and other physical attributes are amplified by the same degree Glory Girl/Antares is to a normal person.  
Your aura is also far more controlled, capable of freely altering what emotion it projects and how powerfully it does so. It can also be directed to specific people, at different potencies, and can be freely expressed in multiple emotions at the same time.  
Your shield is no longer a single forcefield but numerous smaller ones roughly half the size of a dime, and closely resembling a beehive. It’s also much denser, layered 5 fields down, with each shield capable of being manipulated and will automatically move and cycle its formation to make it more difficult to bypass. The first shield will never take more than a second to regenerate, and each layer regenerates twice as fast as the previous.  
The forcefields will no longer flicker due to the user’s own actions, will automatically adjust to cover whatever they’re touching, unless the user would wish otherwise, and are far more malleable than before.  
The forcefield’s defenses are also greater, being capable of handling a direct blow from Behemoth before becoming affected, anything below that threshold not affecting the shield at all, or it will raise up to be 5 times greater than your own defenses, whichever is greater.  
*The Wretch*  
Required:Antares  
Required:(Brute) Telekinetic Barrier  
Required: Victoria Dallon, or Glory Girl  
Your physical abilities have grown tremendously, enough so that a normal person could contest Behemoth through nothing more than physical ability for a long while.  
Your Aura is greatly magnified, becoming capable of influencing the size of a small city at the same time, their aura automatically altering its targeted emotions to shift their target’s mind in a way best beneficial to the user. Those affected by your aura are intuitively aware of your desires and will act to the best of their ability to achieve them.  
Your aura can also work at a very subtle level, engendering loyalty to yourself through your mere presence. It may take two or three weeks of close proximity, but the result is an inner cadre who’d rather gut themselves and butcher families before they betray you.  
But perhaps most importantly is your Forcefield. Your Forcefield is far more fluid and flexible, now acting more like a fluid than a plate. It’s capable of freely shaping and modifying itself to allow you to project force at a distance and extend your barrier to others, acting as a form of telekinesis.  
You have effectively 15 Forcefields active at any time, each capable of completely encompassing 100 meters within its range of influence. The fields do not have to be centered on you, as you are capable of throwing them away from yourself to influence areas further away.  
Fields can be chained together to increase the area of influence by three for each added field, all as one layer, or they can be layered within the same territory to act as they did before. While layered their previously noted interactions apply, namely that they regenerate faster the more layers down you go.  
Each of your Forcefields needs at least 3 hits above their threshold to drop. Your abilities are also magnified 2 fold for every Forcefield you’re inside the area of influence.  
Glory Girl  
Cost: 3 SP  
You have a force field that can block any blow no matter how powerful, but any powerful impact will bring it down for about two seconds, longer if it's a sustained hit. You can fly at almost 80 miles per hour. You have super strength, strong enough to allow you to lift about 14 tons. You have an emotional aura that makes it so those around you are either in awe or fear of you.

Superior Training  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Brute) Unlimited Potential  
You can train more than just your muscles; you can now enhance every aspect of your body. This includes fortifying your immune system against toxins, toughening your skin to resist bullets, and accelerating the development of other abilities or powers. While an intense and harsh training regimen will boost your recovery capabilities, gradual increments will ensure more stable adaptations, providing a solid foundation for long-term improvement.  
Power Muscles  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Brute) Unlimited Potential  
The stronger, faster and generally better your physical form, the more potent and effective your powers become. Additionally, by pushing your powers to their limits, you can further strengthen and refine them. Through repeated exertion and reaching new thresholds, your abilities evolve, becoming stronger, more versatile, and adaptable. The more your powers grow, the stronger your physique becomes as well.  
Temporary boosts to your physique will similarly give temporary boosts to your powers.  
(Brute) Unlimited Potential  
Cost: 15 SP  
As you train, your body adapts. While you will always look human, you no longer have a glass ceiling stopping you from becoming stronger. As long as your training is strenuous, you will always get stronger. The training has to be enough to make you sweat, and your muscles need to hurt at least a little from lactic acid build-up. Fighting will get you significantly more gains than just training.

Magnhild  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required: Dauntless, or Shawn  
Your power has evolved past the need for pre-existing items or daily charges. Now instead, by charging up energy inside of you, you have the ability to create mundane equipment (this includes weapons, armor, clothing) out of energy that you charge up. This equipment that you make can be any mundane equipment that you can think of, also depending on how long you charged up for the equipment will have; increased durability, and one to three powers ranging from weak to a level competing with endbringers.  
Charging up however is not instantaneous, however you could charge for one second to create fragile equipment that would break instantly. Consequently charging for one minute will create something as strong as an ordinary object with the beginnings of a weak power. Charging for two will increase the durability of what you create as well as imbue it with two powers of average strength. And finally charging for three minutes the creation will have all three powers that it can have at an above average strength. For reference it would take charging a creation for five minutes for it to reach a level where it could be competitive with an endbringer.  
This is not without drawbacks however as you are only capable of charging up one equipment at a time. In addition you cannot dictate what powers your creations are imbued or imbue you with instead the powers will be related to what you created. For example creating shoes would have some form of movement based ability while a Bow would have powers related to projectile attacks. These creations also do not last forever as they will “Burn out” after an hour has passed and cease to exist. Creating the same object twice also does not guarantee that it will be imbued with the same properties.  
*Keystone*  
Required:Cornerstone  
The resulting access to the network has greatly improved your ability to charge up and create. You now possess the ability to create equipment directly linked to a section or particular members of your network, as such when creating your equipment you can now dictate what powers to imbue or they will imbue you with. There is now also a change in the creation of your equipment in the fact that you can continually charge up your equipment in order to link it to others that you have already made, doing this will link the created equipment's powers. This link will allow for transferring energy from one item to another.  
Most of all, you finally influence the Shards within your Network, more overtly and keenly, both through your equipment/loadout and Shardspace Simulation as they're linked to either your member's Shards or yours depending on your equipment/loadout's prior configuration, this connection (if used correctly) allows to govern your Network and control the Shards within through optimizing and improving the Shard's "hardware" or "software".  
Charge Siphon  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required: Dauntless, or Shawn  
You have gained a new way of acquiring charges as you now also pull out energy from other sources, using as charges for your equipment. Unfortunately, a single charge is composed of a lot of mundane energy, drawing from parahuman sources, on the other hand, can give you more than a single charge. For example: siphoning the energy from a full car battery would funnel barely a single charge but siphoning the energy from a tinker weapon could harness around five to twenty charges depending on the power source.  
Additionally you now also can pull out the charges from items that you have previously empowered and put them into different items.  
Charge Burn  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required: Dauntless, or Shawn  
Your power centers around placing charges into items to strengthen and grant them power-like effects over time. However, now you can sacrifice charges that you’ve put into items to exponentially increase the strength and power of said item proportional to how many charges you burn through. Still, this boost is temporary and expires slowly over an hour.

Personal Military  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Personal Army  
Your personal army has improved, letting you summon more soldiers, vehicles, and equipment than you started with.  
You have no limit to the number of soldiers or vehicles you can summon, only how many you can summon at once. Per week, you can summon an additional 10 soldiers, 5 lighter vehicles, such as armored cars, 5 heavier vehicles, such as tanks, 5 smaller aircraft, such as fighter planes, and 2 heavier aircraft, such as bombers. The vehicles you summon will have their crew summoned with them.  
Your soldiers are now superhuman, which opens the door for new classes of soldiers you can summon. Your standard soldier now possesses peak human physical capabilities, as well as an increase in skill, allowing them to make key tactical decisions on the fly. Your soldiers can also summon needed ammunition for both themselves and any vehicle you summoned. You will even find yourself and your soldiers immune to friendly fire.  
You can summon ‘classes’, special types of soldiers that have their profession ramped to higher capabilities. These build off of your standard soldiers, keeping their superhuman capabilities. These classes are split into two versions, lesser and higher.  
Lesser classes are classes that provide a smaller amount of effects. This can range from a cook that can produce extremely good food, a general that can command an army without speaking an order, a medic that can induce regeneration, or a mechanic that can repair vehicles at an abnormally fast rate. A single lesser class can be summoned once a week.  
Higher classes are the pinnacle of classes, with a variety of potential powers this can range from a cook that makes food that grants abilities, a general that has a lesser version of your summoning abilities, a medic that can bring back the recently deceased, or a mechanic that can maintain and repair tinker tech. A single higher class can be summoned once a month.  
Should any of your soldiers die, they can be re-summoned after an hour, and any damaged vehicle will find itself fixed and in a retrievable position after an hour.  
The Trees Started Speaking Vietnamese  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Personal Army  
Your army’s technology level has increased to the level of the world at the end of the Vietnam War. Your current equipment and vehicles are updated. New vehicles are added to your arsenal, including 24 transport helicopters, 12 attack helicopters, 20 transport planes, 15 reconnaissance planes, 5 electronic warfare planes, 20 river patrol boats and a mobile riverine base. The crews needed for these vehicles are added to your army.  
Desert Storm  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:The Trees Started Speaking Vietnamese  
Your army is now advanced to the modern age. From modern 5th generation planes to advanced main battle tanks, you gain units fit for the modern age. In addition, you now have a unit dedicated to drone operations. You gain 10 large UAVs, 15 small UAVs, and 5 Unmanned Surface Vehicles. You gain the required equipment and operators to operate these.  
Advanced Warfare  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:Desert Storm  
Your army’s technology has now advanced to near-future technology. This stocks your army with lower end tinker tech. From military exoskeletons to laser rifles, your army now looks like it is out of a sci fi movie.  
Air Land and Sea  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Personal Army  
Your army now has a naval detachment of the same technology level as your army. Your naval detachment consists of 1 carrier, 2 battleships, 2 cruisers, 3 destroyers, 3 frigates, 2 submarines, 2 minesweepers, 1 hospital ship, 5 landing ships, and 2 auxiliary ships. Your naval forces will be staffed with the appropriate personnel and equipment on board, and will possess the same benefits and loyalty as your army.  
And The Caissons Go Rolling Along  
Cost: 1 SP  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Personal Army  
An artillery and mortar detachment has been added to your army. You gain 24 stationary artillery pieces, 30 mortar teams, 17 rocket artillery pieces, and 16 self-propelled artillery pieces. The crews needed to operate and target these are added to your army.  
Multiversal Legion  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:Advanced Warfare  
Your Personal Army can now be equipped with any individual-level technology you know how to build. This includes equipment derived from powers you personally have, such as Tinker Powers or Technology and Artifice Powers. If you possess no such abilities or knowledge, this upgrade will have little to no effect.  
However, if you do, the results are transformative. For example, if you understand Star Wars technology, your soldiers can be summoned with stormtrooper armor and blasters, and vehicles like AT-ATs or TIE Fighters can replace their tank and airplane counterparts. While each piece of equipment must follow a single tech tree, your army and soldiers as a whole can mix technologies from multiple trees as long as you understand them.  
All equipment generated through this upgrade is “user-specific” and tied directly to the soldier or vehicle it was summoned with. These items cannot be stockpiled, reverse-engineered, exploited for resources, or used by others, and they disappear if the soldier dies.  
The adaptability of your army is directly linked to your knowledge. If you lose understanding of a particular tech tree, any soldiers or vehicles using that technology will immediately vanish. Furthermore if you gain knowledge, by capturing or reverse engineering technology, you can incorporate that new technology into your soldiers.  
This upgrade allows your Personal Army to become a versatile and powerful force, limited only by your expertise and imagination.  
*Strategic Overhaul*  
Required: Air Land and Sea, or And The Caissons Go Rolling Along  
You can now replace naval and artillery units generated by Personal Army upgrades with equivalents from the technology trees you understand. These replacements fully integrate into your army but remain "user-specific" in nature, tied to the units they are summoned with and unable to be repurposed outside of their intended use.  
*Tactical Integration*  
Required:Ares, Legion of One  
You and your summoned soldiers gain complete knowledge of the strategies, tactics, and doctrines optimized for your advanced technology. This includes an understanding of how historical wars might have been fought with your technology, allowing you to apply refined, battle-tested approaches tailored to your equipment.  
In essence, you and your forces acquire the tactical expertise of hypothetical wars shaped by your advancements. This eliminates disparities in strategy when utilizing multiple tech trees, ensuring your forces can seamlessly integrate diverse technologies and maximize their potential in complex combat scenarios.  
*Vanguard Evolution *  
Required:Personal Military  
Your summoned units now retroactively gain any items or equipment they would have had if they were summoned at this moment, ensuring all your forces benefit from your most up-to-date technological advancements. Additionally, soldiers no longer vanish if you lose access to a specific tech tree, making your army more stable and reliable over time.  
Your summoning rate now scales additively, doubling for every 10 SP you spend on Technology or Tinker powers. For example, spending 20 SP increases your production rate to triple its base level. This scaling applies to all summoned forces, including soldiers, vehicles, and both lesser and higher classes, allowing your army to grow larger and more powerful as you invest in technological expertise.  
(Master/Thinker) Personal Army  
Cost: 15 SP  
You have your own personal army with technology equivalent to World War 2 comprised of 1000 soldiers, 300 armoured personnel carriers, 240 armoured cars, 25 tanks, 30 fighters, and 15 bombers. They are appropriately manned with the required personnel. If you summon them, it will look like they come out of a portal. If someone or something is ever destroyed, they or it can be summoned to peak condition after a week. All of the soldiers are 110% loyal to you, willing to eat and die in your name. They aren't exactly resistant to master effects, but their loyalty will never waiver. You always know where your soldiers and equipment are and if they are still in working condition. Any information they gather will be known to you. They also know what you know and what you want them to do.

Eldritch Sight  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Twisted World  
Your sight has grown stronger, allowing you to see deeper into reality. Now, any powers meant to obscure will not work on you. Be it invisibility, memory alteration, or clouds of darkness.   
Additionally, you can now see physical representations of emotions and desires. They regularly take the form of twisted mythological creatures and tend to either follow and latch on to people, or congregate in an area. You can communicate with these creatures, even make deals with them. They can choose to latch onto people you ask them to, causing their target to be affected by whatever emotion and/or desire the creature represents.  
*We Need More Eyes*  
Required:Tattletale  
Your insight deepens. You no longer gain headaches from using your Thinker power. Now, you can even see physical representations of knowledge, information, and the like. Additionally, all the physical representations are willing to answer questions you ask them, most even giving you information without prompting, and they are now more likely to obey you even if you don’t give them anything in return.   
You can now also create these representations by temporarily losing parts of yourself. By sacrificing your anger, you can make a physical representation of anger. Know that these creatures are still unable to directly interact with the physical world.   
*Lucid Dreamer*  
Required:Labyrinth  
You see the dark corners of reality and bring them to the light. You can physically manifest the twisted reality that you see into reality, superimposing it over the true reality. You can summon the physical representation, all of them having a memetic influence over anyone who perceives them.  
Your most interesting power is to superimpose the twisted variants of others onto themselves, allowing them to see themselves in their truest form.  
*Bare Witness*  
Required:(Thinker) Retroactive Empath  
Your powers have evolved into a chilling synthesis of perceptive abilities, allowing you to read the emotional history of anything you can see, and even slightly beyond it. When you focus on an object, person, or place, you can see past events happen in real time, only replaced with horrific creatures embodying the true self and thoughts of those involved. These visions are deeply rooted in the emotions that permeated those moments, providing an almost hauntingly clear understanding of the past. This is particularly effective in spaces where emotions and desires are strong or have been strong.  
(Thinker) Twisted World  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can see a second layer of reality. This reality is a mirror of the true reality, but distorted by emotions and past actions. You can see actions that have happened in an area, to a limited degree, see the mental state of a person in physical form, and hear the true feeling and thoughts of people around you unfiltered. When looking at an office worker, you may see a distorted version of them, where they are skinny and half dead, overworked. When looking at a murder scene you may see puddles of blood that aren’t there. When someone is talking, you do not hear what they said, but what they feel and think unfiltered. Your eyes are open and you see the world for what it truly is. You and anyone else who has this power is immune to the distortion in the second reality, thus appearing as yourselves. You can toggle this on and off.

Child of Echidna  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Changer/Striker) Echidna  
Are you, you? One couldn’t be faulted for thinking otherwise. If I hadn’t known otherwise I would have assumed Echidna had managed to grab ahold of you and create her Magnus Opus.  
You’re noticeably better in all aspects, healthier, faster, stronger, smarter, your powers overall more potent and possessing some new secondary aspects.  
Most importantly however you’ve gained the ability to incorporate the properties of those you touch into yourself. This allows you to incorporate the ability of up to 3 (5 if Shardless/Negentropic) other Parahumans into yourself at the same time.  
Your changer form is much more powerful as well, capable of contesting and trapping even Alexandria without much issue.

You can freely choose whether what you possess is a perfect copy of their abilities or a different expression, you can alter this at any time.  
*Shard Clone*  
Required:Clone Absorber  
When you clone a parahuman, you inherit a diluted version of their powers. This means you could gain an array of minor abilities depending on the parahuman cloned. For instance, replicating a pyrokinetic might grant you the ability to withstand extreme temperatures, manipulate fire to a limited extent, or even generate heat in small doses. You have no limit on how many minor powers you can have activated at once.  
*Heir of Echidna*  
Required:(Trump) Manager  
Required:(Trump) Oberon  
Your ability is immense, you don’t just replicate the ability of those you touch but you can now possess a noticeably more powerful version of their ability.  
Your innate improvements are thrice as impressive, and you can freely alter the powers and capabilities in your possession at will.  
By focusing when incorporating the powers of another into yourself you can call upon more powerful variations of their abilities, this takes 30 seconds. You can also freely call upon exact copies or expressions of powers of equal strength without any time requirements. Your Oberon and Manager slots are now one and the same and included into Echidna’s slots, gaining all the benefits of each other's capabilities.  
This also allows you to freely alter the power expressions of your creations, even at a distance, as well as making your own form far more flexible. You can now alter yourself in the same vein as you would have those you’ve copied. From simple physical changes such as a more healthy appearance to an entire overhaul of the mind and body.  
*Child of Monsters*  
Required:(Brute) Typhon  
Any parahuman that touches you becomes unable to use their powers if you don’t allow it. When in your changer form you gain a second core within it and can regenerate at an absurd pace, as long as both of your cores are intact you can't die.  
(Changer/Striker) Echidna  
Cost: 35 SP  
You gain the horrific ability to clone anything that you touch, with some alterations. Clones will typically resemble their source template but will still be distinctly different. You only have to touch something once in order to make clones of them.  
Things you clone are generally more powerful than their sources, typically more healthy and overall better in almost every way.  
In the case of parahumans those you clone will typically possess a greater and/or alternate version of their source's power. You can choose what category they fall in or leave it entirely up to chance.  
You can shapeshift into a giant monstrous new form that looks like a gray and red glob, this form is where you generate the clones, creating them directly inside the glob and releasing them. Your changer form can start to incorporate the features of those you’ve cloned, becoming more mobile and more powerful over time.  
Clones will typically possess personality similar to their sources, but will be innately loyal to you and won’t act against you, your goals, or instructions regardless of other factors. Note that this does not exclude them from being tricked or mastered to do so, only that they won’t do so willingly. If you're shardless you can choose to make any clones Shardless as well.  
*Spectral Clones*  
Required:(Trump) Faerie Queen  
You gain the ability to create clones of those you touch as spectral clones instead of going through the traditional method of creating a full blown clone. This takes up a slot from Fairy Queen to use.  
*Angrboda*  
Required:(Master) Cloning  
(Master) Cloning has been assimilated into this power and greatly enhanced it. Now, you are able to sense through any clone you create. Additionally, upon contact with a living being, the clone automatically stores the creature's template, allowing you to use that template to create new clones. Furthermore, you can temporarily grant any clone a base version of your changer state, allowing you to create clones through them.  
Should you take any of the upgrades of (Master) Cloning, it will also be assimilated.  
*Blueprint*  
Required:Panacea  
Your power doesn’t just create direct clones, instead your power allows you to analyze and store the information from anything you touch, which you can then incorporate into anything you work on later. You can still create clones of them at will.  
This allows you to perform acts such as incorporating the powers of a Parahuman into someone else, creating exact clones of someone except loyal to yourself, to even creating the equivalent of possible children of templates you have had the opportunity to touch.  
This also allows you to generate clones without turning into your changed form, simply needing to touch biological material to affect it as you would with Panacea. On the flip side, your changer form can also be used to generate new things wholesale for your biokinetic abilities, allowing you to create things directly out of the glob.  
This allows you to incorporate the features of all that you would have normally just cloned into anything you work.  
*Instant Creation*  
Required:Panacea  
Required:(Trump) Oberon  
Required:(Trump) Faerie Queen  
Your ability to summon shades of Elfame allows you to forgo the traditional method of creating a clone, instead you can now sacrifice a slot to immediately make a creation with the features you want. The slot will regenerate after 1 hour.

Pyrotechnic Colourant  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Blaster/Trump) Burnout  
Powers that you’ve recently burned will give your flames a temporary thematically related boost. i.e. burning a speedster might make your flames spread faster; an object empowered to be tougher might make your flames be harder to stamp out; a teleporter might let your flames teleport gaps to spread to more flammable materials; etc.  
(Blaster/Trump) Burnout  
Cost: 13 SP  
You are a pyrokinetic, being capable of conjuring and manipulating your own brand of special purple flames. These flames, in addition to burning normal materials, also burn parahuman powers.  
Upon coming into contact with a supernatural effect, it will set it aflame and burn it away no matter the durability. These flames are even capable of consuming invisible/immaterial effects like Shaker auras, all or nothing effects and things that are currently under the effects of a power (empowered by a Striker ability, telekinetically controlled, under a Master effect, etc.) no matter the objects' original flammability for as long as they remain under an effect.  
These flames don't burn tinkertech any better than they would any other normal machinery, since they’re not power effects.  
The Pharmacist  
Cost: 12 SP  
You’re a pyrokinetic with the ability to manifest purple flames from your hands. You can manually increase the intensity of the fires you create, and extinguish them at will. However, you can only extinguish fires that you can see. Your flames ignite nearby active powers, spreading across them like normal fire across oil. For example, this effect applies to Breaker forms, Shaker effects, and even Master effects. Your flames also ignore power-based invulnerability. Although the purple fires don’t chase after Thinker powers, they can blind them or be painful to perceive.

Not So Scarlet  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Trump/Master) Chrysalis  
The colour of the highlight of your Kamikos now covers their entire body, and you are no longer limited to only having one; you are now able to instantly turn any of your butterflies that enter contact with you into Kamikos, allowing you to have a greater number of Champions.  
Your pool of energy (Magic with Esoteric Knowledge/Shardless) grows by an order of magnitude, and your champions have a 40% reduction in their energy consumption.  
   
You can control your weakest Champions with ease, as if they were your actual body (doing this makes their eyes glow the colour of your Kamiko), but the stronger they are, the harder it is to do so. It once again becomes easy if they give you permission.  
When you try making a Champion you automatically know a Transformation that fits; you don't need to use it and can instead design it on your own as you always did.  
(Trump/Master) Chrysalis  
Cost: 25 SP  
You gain the capacity to sense sentiments and desires within 100 kilometers of you. By concentrating on the sentiments/desires someone is feeling, you gain knowledge of what caused them and can hear what they are currently thinking.  
You are able to create white butterflies that you can sense through and command them by giving them orders telepathically, though this telepathic link only works within the range of your emotion sense. Within you, there's a large pool of energy that you can imbue into one of your butterflies through touch. This turns that butterfly into a Kamiko, and their colour becomes black with highlights of a colour of your choice. The pool regenerates slowly, but eating food fills it completely, and with time, it will grow in size. Kamikos are extremely flexible, giving them the capacity to pass through very small gaps and be able to sense emotions in a much smaller range than yours. You can only have one Kamiko at a time; trying to make another one will just result in you wasting the energy from your pool.  
Your Kamiko can possess an object that someone has an emotional connection with; the possessed object becomes black, a mental connection with that being is established, and their sentiments/desires are amplified and reinforced. This connection allows you to access their senses and telepathically communicate with them. Every time you do that, a glowing (with the colour of the highlight of your Kamiko) outline of a mask in the shape of a butterfly appears in front of their and your faces. You can offer them a transformation that will change their body, make them have unlimited stamina, and give them powers (being able to amplify and change existing ones), together with a name for this transformation. If they agree to it, their body will be engulfed by a bubbling energy of the colour of your Kamiko, upon which the change is made, and they will become your Champion. If their object breaks, their transformation ends, and all their active power effects will cease to exist. The same applies if you make the Kamiko leave its object. Although you normally can only have one Champion at a time due to your Kamiko limit, if multiple people share the same object and their sentiments and desires align, they will become multiple Champions or fuse into a single one. You can only retrieve a Kamiko and communicate with your Champion within your emotional sense range.  
The powers from the transformation are fueled by your pool of energy, and the stronger they are, the more energy they consume, while the maximum strength of the powers you can give is 30 SP total. The transformation must align with your Champions sentiments/desires, the context behind those feelings, and themselves. You can't give someone who refuses to hurt anyone under any circumstances a power that can only be used to hurt, nor can you give someone who is tired of running away from their problems sentient minions that they can command from another city, but you could give the first one a power whose capacity to hurt is secondary or give the second one the capacity to create clones that house his consciousness. If you Champion yourself, you won't be able to change or amplify Chrysalis, and if a Champion has the capacity to amplify or grant powers to others, it must be either temporary, limited to only 1 or both.  
If you have Shardless or Esoteric Knowledge, your pool of energy will instead be magic aligned with the concepts of Transmission, Influence, and Change, with each concept giving you an extra ability; with Transmission comes the capacity to temporarily transfer to your Champions any of your powers with the exception of Chrysalis; with Influence comes the capacity to compel someone to accept your offer of Championship and with Change comes the capacity for a transformation to become permanent. If your Champion stays transformed for a long time, the stronger the Champion the more time they need. If a Champion becomes permanent, they no longer need your Magic to use their powers, and you can use your Kamiko on someone else. You are still able to communicate with them as if they had a Kamiko. Besides that, it allows your Champions to actually have esoteric abilities like magic instead of imitations, and with time and effort, you can develop new capabilities based on those concepts or enhance ones that you already have (like making your Kamiko phase through walls). Those capabilities will use your pool of magic to function.  
*Zone of Change*  
Required:(Master) Khepri  
Anything that you take control of using Khepri becomes a Champion without you needing to use a Kamiko. You gain the capacity to use past Emotions/Desires to design the transformation of your Champions.

Don't Tattle On Me\!  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required: Sarah Livsey/Lisa Wilbourn, or Tattletale  
Now, even with barely any evidence, you are able to get accurate deductions. Your senses are attuned to all aspects of your power, allowing you to analyse any and all information it is giving you at all times, not only allowing you to be able to tell when someone is fooling your power, but also preventing you from being overwhelmed by the flow of information it provides.  
A single misplaced leaf can allow you to tell the direction of where someone ran to, a few brushes of paint, and you can already tell what someone is going to paint, your power has the deductive capability of a detective powered by plot convenience.  
Tattletale  
Cost: 4 SP  
Your power helps you deduce things, oftentimes without sufficient evidence. However, without enough evidence you can get really incorrect answers. You will get headaches if you use this power too much.

Laguz  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:Othala  
You may grant powers out of a set such as pyrokinesis, regeneration, flight, super-speed, augmented strength, telekinesis, enhanced reflexes, a pocket dimension, a power nullifying aura, or invincibility to up to 3 powers a person. You can also grant your powers to yourself. You may adjust the potency and duration of the powers you give out. But the potency and duration will always be inversely proportional.  
Othala  
Cost: 8 SP  
You have a trump power that lets you grant one out of a set of powers to one person at a time, such as pyrokinesis, regeneration or invincibility.

Vodou  
Cost: 18 SP  
Required:(Blaster) Voodoo  
You gained the ability to construct dolls through which you can manipulate others. After constructing or getting a basic doll, you can imbue it to utilize your power. When imbuing a doll with your power, you have two choices concerning linking to someone. Either you can establish a permanent link to someone upon the doll’s creation, or to leave it blank.

If a link is established at creation the doll’s connection can temporarily or indefinitely be overridden as long as the doll has something attached to it representing another target, but will immediately revert if the item loses contact with the doll. The doll will require no item to affect its normal target.  
If a doll is left blank, you can instead establish permanent links later on as long as you attach something representing the target on the doll. If it directly belonged to the target such as a lock of hair, the doll’s link is established immediately, if it merely represents the target such as a commonly distributed picture such as a newspaper clipping it takes 1 day for the doll’s link to establish. Once the link is established the item no longer needs to be attached, and the link can be overwritten with another by simply following the process again.

The link is permanent unless broken by you. If the link is broken and the doll is still intact, you can establish it with someone else or a previous target without having to construct a new doll. The doll after you imbue it becomes almost entirely indestructible, requiring an All or Nothing power to destroy it. This includes any writing you make on the doll yourself.  
By holding the doll you can will it to grow into a person sized doll, allowing you the room to write on them, and to shrink it back to normal size at will. Whatever you write on the dolls becomes true for the one they’re affecting. The dolls will know what you intend with each word you write, so writing “tall” will make them as tall as you wanted them to be. You still have to make your wording complete.  
By focusing you can imbue a word with far more meaning into it than its normal definition, turning into a Major Word, taking effect when they are written and bypassing the need for full wording. You can create a Major word once a week, after creation the Major word can be used as many times as you want. The Major Word can also be used normally whenever you wish, and the same word can be turned into multiple versions of a Major Word, producing different effects with the same writing.  
You have a limit of 10 words per doll upon creation, however each day the doll remains in existence the limit of words increases by half. Others can write on the dolls if you allow it, but only if you allow it. You can wipe off any writing at any time without any effort.  
The doll can also be used to manipulate a target in a more traditional way, such as throwing them or crushing them by crushing the dolls. This only happens when you wish for it to. The target does not need to be a person, the doll can affect any being.  
(Blaster) Voodoo  
Cost: 7 SP  
By using clay figures, paintings, or just someone's photos, you can affect the one it is resembling by interacting with it.  
The severity of injuries or effects you can inflict depends on the nature and accuracy of the items used.

Otherworldly Archive  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Shaker/Master) Beasts of Gaia  
This archive delves into alternate or alien worlds visited by entities in the past, cataloging various alien and mythological creatures and animals that can be summoned by the user. It's important to note that these creatures cannot reproduce. Among the creatures available for summoning are kitsunes, dire wolves, dragons, and even extraterrestrial beings from other worlds. Each creature retains its natural abilities.  
The Archive provides a comprehensive mental list of summonable creatures, complete with detailed descriptions, species names, and any special abilities they possess. This wealth of information empowers users to select the desired creature for their needs, giving them full control over their summoning choices. However, users are limited in the number of creatures and animals they can summon, as they are not natural to your version of Earth.  
Wildlife Sanctuary  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Shaker/Master) Beasts of Gaia  
You now gain a pocket dimension with an ocean and an island that act as a home to any creatures you summon or control. This Power enables you to carry around your animals and creatures. The island has an ecosystem that is changing and adapting to any animal or creature that lives there; the island is expanded as animals or creatures are added over time; and as the island expands and grows, new biomes will appear, allowing you to have different areas like a snowy region or a tropical area. If you are able to summon mythical or extra-terrestrial animals and creatures, then two new islands will be added for them.  
Animals and creatures can now breed with the same member of their species and crossbreed with others. This feature is only available inside the sanctuary. Any creature or animal that is hurt is returned to the sanctuary to heal. Please note that small and big game will be naturally included on the island, allowing for the animals to hunt each other or the various types of small and big game located around the island.  
(Shaker/Master) Beasts of Gaia  
Cost: 16 SP  
You now possess the ability to call and summon animals to aid you. You can radiate an inaudible frequency reaching up to five kilometers that any non-sapient animals will feel compelled to follow. Additionally, you can summon a single non-sapient animal of your choice at a time from anywhere on Earth \- you can choose to summon any animal possessing a certain characteristic, any animal of a specific species or even a specific animal such as your own pet. You can even access the past and summon any animal or creature to the present moment. This includes alternate Earths where different species may have thrived. You can send it back to where you summoned it from and summon a different animal at any time, and if it sustains significant injuries, it will be automatically unsummoned and returned to its original location. You will receive detailed descriptions of all creatures available for summoning. It's worth noting that animals or creatures brought from the past to the present cannot breed.  
Any such called or summoned creature will be loyal to you and will be empowered similarly to a mid-range Brute; a monkey could flip a car, while an elephant might be able to win a toss-up against a tinkertech monster truck. You can also share the senses of any animal you called or summoned, and even communicate with them.  
~~Over time, this power will induce physical changes in the user, such as small fangs, slit eyes, claws, or even a tai~~l. Additionally, you gain heightened senses akin to those of the animals you control. Eventually, your ability to communicate with animals you summoned or called will be extended to every animal.  
If you have negentropy, you can now summon up to three animals simultaneously, and the amount of animals you can summon will grow over time.  
*Arcadia*  
Required:(Brute) Avalon  
Beast of Gaia and Avalon have both synergized thanks to their shared effects on animals. Avalon uses this connection to give your summoned animals an enhanced healing factor along with enhanced durability and stamina. It is also now possible to summon up to three animals without negentropy, with negentropy allowing for an immediate five and causing that amount to grow at an accelerated rate.

Role Mastered  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Roleplay  
You now gain up to 5 SP total whenever you take a role. For example, if you take the role "Chef", you will gain a 4 SP tinker ability to cook food and a 1 SP thinker ability to know your target's favourite food.  
If you have Actors On Stage this can grant others powers based on the roles you give. This is optional.  
Actors on Stage  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Roleplay  
You now have a Master power that allows you to enforce specific “Roles” onto people within your surroundings. For example, you can make Alexandria play the role as a “Helpless Maiden”, and she will be forced to only act in a way a “Helpless Maiden” would act. Or perhaps you can make Armsmaster play the role of “Comic Relief”, thus forcing him to act in a humorous manner. Whenever you force a role onto someone, this grants them the skills needed to play that role.  
*Costumes*  
Required: Magical Girl, or (Striker/Tinker) Dress Up\!  
Those affected by your powers will also have their equipment altered to fit their role. If given the role of “Policeman”, the target's clothes will be altered to look like a police outfit, at least superficially so.  
*Inner Actor*  
Required:(Master) Dominate  
Those affected by your powers will truly believe that they are their role. A person who is given the role of a “Traumatised Soldier” will not only act like one, but truly think they are one. While the effects are permanent as long as they have their role, it can be broken if someone points out the inconsistencies of their beliefs.  
*Stage Set*  
Required: Labyrinth, or Holodeck  
Now the area around you is also altered to suit the situation. You also have the ability to enforce a “script” upon everyone and everything under the effects of your power. The “Hero” always beats the “Villain”, the “Side Character” is always second to the “Main Character”.  
Note that you can’t make things too absurd happen, it has to have some kind of build up, plot progression, etc. You can also choose to have a “script” continue on from an earlier “script”, essentially making a continuation. Your power weakens the less your “script” makes sense.  
Archetype Controller  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:Actors on Stage  
Your Master power deepened even further, instead of enforcing “roles” onto others with the world agreeing, you now control the very framework these roles are based on: Archetypes.  
Archetypes are patterns, images, and models fundamentally instinctual within humanity, leading to a common understanding or sense of values; inherited from our ancestors generally conforming to accepted designs and interpretations, they can be altered per individual personal nature and experiences. You administer this essential part of our psyche to the point of irrevocably changing someone’s psyche.  
For example, you can change someone’s archetype when it comes to another, whether it be a friend or co-worker, to someone reprehensible and acts accordingly against the latter; you can fabricate an archetype that causes anyone to mark you as forgettable or unable to be remembered; you can even remove an archetype from someone, that is a criminal, and eliminate the Criminal Archetype within his psyche, which outright erases any prospect of delinquent behavior.  
*Collective Unconscious*  
Required:Mr. Worldwide  
Your control finally reaches the entire Collective Unconscious of Humanity, which means, you can change mankind’s collective archetypical paradigms and foundations globally.  
(Thinker) Roleplay  
Cost: 5 SP  
Roleplay allows you to assume the skills of a single character or role at a time, attaining their peak human abilities. By immersing yourself in the role, you gain their expertise and excel in various fields.

Shear  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Blaster/Striker) Sting  
On account of Sting’s growth, both as a defense tool for both Entities and any threat alike, this advancement goes a different route: Using quantum mechanics as basis, especially the phenomenon of quantum teleportation (which consists of the transference of quantum information to another in an entangled state, giving the appearance of teleporting particles or atoms to another) to sunder and disconnect any molecular/atomic bonds it comes across either through a projectile or tools infused with this. For example, infuse Shear to a blade and this cuts through Endbringer layered flesh like butter.  
While apparently redundant (Sting didn’t see much need to evolve on the eyes of Entities), this addresses any threat where Sting’s usual workings aren’t enough and its weakness exploited, Shear is better seen as a local dimension contingency measure utilizing Sting’s ability to subvert physical laws to ensure its effectivity, being an complement as much as an upgrade.  
No Chance Of Surviving This Shot  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Blaster/Striker) Sting  
Now the consequences of things you infuse with Sting spread to everything that is/was a part/extension of what you hit. The exceptions are celestial bodies (that aren't comets or meteors), in that case the maximum range for the spread is 30 meters.  
What this means in essence is that shooting someone's prosthetic would result in the hole expanding in depth until it goes to the other side, while similar holes would appear everywhere on the target's body until there is nothing left, including atoms. Cut Genesis projection and not only will said projection be reduced to nothing but Genesis will too. Infuse a lighter and its flames will burn your enemies until there is nothing left.  
You have control over this effect, allowing you to speed up and down the spread of it and even stop it entirely. You can even control where the effect will hit, allowing you to immediately cut someone's brain right after cutting their hand instead of waiting for the effect to spread, you gain an awareness of everything you can affect from your target in order to do so.  
The destruction of the atoms of something has no consequences, though this can be turned off and on at will.  
(Blaster/Striker) Sting  
Cost: 25 SP  
You can infuse anything you can touch, any projectile you fire, or any power you manifest, with the ability to ignore select laws of physics, including the ability to pass through anything. These will not pass through your own body unless you will them to. You cannot empower yourself with this. Along with this ability, you also have an intuitive understanding of angles, trajectories, as well as an enhanced sense of timing.  
Flechette/Foil  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can infuse nonliving objects with the ability to ignore select laws of physics, including the ability to go through anything. You also have an intuitive understanding of angles and trajectories as well as an enhanced sense of timing.

Spirit of All Things  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required: (Striker) Machine Spirit  
When you touch an object, whether it's a sword, a sleek car, or a house, you can infuse it with sentience. Once awakened, these creations become more than mere objects, gaining the ability to act autonomously. A sentient sword may wield itself with precision, a car navigates winding roads with ease, and a house tidies its own rooms with care.  
These creations, now imbued with intelligence, not only serve you faithfully but also develop a sense of loyalty akin to reverence, recognizing you as their creator. Beyond their newfound autonomy, they possess additional capabilities such as self-repair and the ability to manipulate themselves with minor telekinetic prowess, allowing them to move despite not having the anatomy for it.  
*Spirit Materialisation*  
Required:Monster Squad  
As the objects are infused with intelligence, they undergo a remarkable transformation, transcending their inanimate nature to assume human forms. This metamorphosis imbues them with a semblance of humanity, each embodying traits reflective of their original purpose.  
A sword, now transformed into a human, wields an aura of elegance and grace, possessing the innate ability to slice through any obstacle with a mere touch. Alongside this formidable power, they may possess additional abilities such as heightened agility, keen perception, and a mastery of combat techniques.  
Similarly, a car transformed into human form exudes a palpable sense of speed and efficiency. With the power to manipulate kinetic energy to propel themselves forward at astonishing velocities, allowing them to traverse vast distances in the blink of an eye, they command the roads with unparalleled swiftness. Accompanying this primary ability, they might possess secondary powers such as enhanced reflexes and intuitive knowledge of navigation.  
They can stay in this form indefinitely, as you no longer have any stamina drain to keep them summoned, however you have a limit to how many human forms you can grant per week, that being 10 forms per week.  
You can choose their appearance, or you can simply allow it to be random or based on their original form.  
(Striker) Machine Spirit  
Cost: 5 SP  
You have the power to bless a machine with a spirit, guiding it in your chosen direction. The disposition of these creations is not tethered to their form; whether a tank aiding its pilots, a toaster thirsting for blood, or a printer dutifully obeying commands, the original purpose of the object has minimal sway over its essence, for good or ill.  
Examples of usage can focus on the maximization of their function, such as enhancing a gun's accuracy to precisely hit the wielder's desired target, prolonging a sword's sharpness, or just making a Machine gain a trait not common seen on them, like a hyper-aggressive toaster that will burn all bread put on them because they want Humanity to suffer, it can too enable more autonomous functionalities in modern devices like planes, cars, or smartphones. These will have options to be more "Autonomous", such as a A.I.-like help, self-driving if the device can move for itself in the hardware front, or more.  
(Additionally, all machine spirits gain imperceptible durability through metaphysical means and minor self-repair abilities tailored for preservation and maintenance purposes.)  
Their emotional level has a broad spectrum, from highly emotional to extremely logical, with intelligence ranging from that of a child to that of an adult human, and the more powerful and precise you make, the more time you need to awaken their spirit. All of them can and will grow with stimuli, gaining new traits based on the experience and intensity.  
As their creator, All Blessed Machines hold you in high regard. However, their affections can shift, and they may develop favorites beyond you.

Monster Squad  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required: (Master) Chessman  
When you touch any non-intelligent object or creature, it suddenly transforms into a horrific and monstrous mutation of its former self. The mutated monster will inherit the object's intended purpose or natural abilities, transformed to ludicrous extremes.  
For example, a Matryoshka doll might evolve into a gargantuan doll with the ability to summon smaller versions of itself. Another example is a simple sunflower transforming into a giant plant monster capable of shooting beams of sunlight. You could also make a figurine of a hero grow to become a lifesize version that has the hero’s power and personality.  
These minions will possess their own self-awareness and are completely subservient to you, their master. Their duration is tied to your stamina; the more you create at once, the more stamina it costs to maintain. You can use extra stamina to control the appearance, personality, and abilities of your minions. You can choose to scale down the strength of your minions to minimize the stamina cost, although you can also do the reverse.  
(Master) Chessman  
Cost: 20 SP  
You are able to animate and manipulate objects to fit your needs. However, the objects need to meet specific guidelines in order for you to do so. The objects must be palm-sized before they are animated and will grow to human-sized after the animation process is complete. To use this power, you must spend time using the objects and detailing or improving their quality. The durability and quality of the animated object are directly related to the starting material and the amount of time you spend using or improving it.  
The power of the animated objects is directly related to how you understand the rules governing the object's source material. Melee weapons or ballistics, which have simpler rules, can be easier for you to replicate than more complex systems, such as magic, which can have highly varied and unpredictable attacks.  
Shard limitations prevent the user from making anything that would match the power of an Endbringer. In addition to those limitations, the duration of your minions is tied to your stamina; the more you create at once as well as the more complex the rules their powers work by, the more stamina it costs to maintain. 

Automatic Defense  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Danger Sense  
Your powers now operate much more smoothly, requiring almost no conscious effort on your part. Your danger sense is now tied directly to your reflexes and other powers and will act automatically in your defense.  
Your danger sense is also much more refined, capable of intuiting a much greater deal of information, almost acting as a form of clairvoyance.  
They can act in your defense, even when you’re unaware, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated. They’ll automatically move your body out of the way such as activating your flight, teleporting you away, or even simply moving your body’s muscles reflexively to defend you.  
This will only happen should you under normal circumstances wish for it, allowing you to harm yourself if you wish, albeit it’ll automatically minimize it as much as possible to meet your need.  
Danger Level  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Danger Sense  
By thinking of something, you can get a number that dictates how dangerous they are to you or those close to you. The higher the number the worse the danger. For example, by thinking what is the cause of the Case 53s, you will probably get a high danger number as Cauldron doesn’t like being known. This also automatically activates on anything (Thinker) Danger Sense detects.  
(Thinker) Danger Sense  
Cost: 9 SP  
You gain a vague sense that can instinctively inform you of various dangers and threats. You can instinctively sense all kinds of things such as poisonous gas, Shaker effects, traps, lies, and even hidden things. The greater the danger the more foreboding it is. The closer it is to the present, the more accurate it is.  
*General Sense*  
Required:Thinker (Gut Instinct)  
It seems like your danger sense isn't limited to danger anymore, but to everything. You could sense an object you will need in the future, sense the fake doppelganger between 2 individuals who look the same, sense what buttons to press to gain access to a computer, sense someone following you, and more.

Great Mage  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Myrddin  
You can choose to bind up to three pocket dimensions, enhancing your access and control over these spaces. With sufficient effort and stamina, you can shape or modify these chosen pocket dimensions to better align with your needs.  
For example, a pocket dimension filled with compressed air can be transformed to produce either superheated or chilled air. Similarly, in a dimension with a gravity vacuum, you can intensify the gravity or modify it to be selective. Generally, you possess the flexibility to adjust the properties of your bound dimensions in numerous ways, although you can’t conjure new effects from nothing. The more complex the modification, the more challenging and energy-consuming it becomes to implement.  
You can drop any of the three selected pocket dimensions at any time. However, once unbound any modifications you've made to the dimension will revert to their original state.  
Myrddin  
Cost: 9 SP  
You can access a variety of pocket dimensions to banish people, create blasts of wind, collect matter and shoot it as a bullet, fly, and clean up radiation. You can also glimpse how powers work.  
Magus  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Great Mage  
Required:Rune  
With this power, your runes can become a conduit allowing them to act as a bridge between your pocket dimensions or telekinesis. You can now inscribe runes on any object, effectively turning them into anchors. These runes can be finely tuned to control various aspects, such as the type of dimension they access, their activation duration, and the intensity of their effects. However, the stronger the rune, the longer it takes to inscribe, with the process varying from a few seconds to several minutes. You can only have up to 30 runes at a time.  
You possess complete awareness of your runes' locations up to a 50-meter radius and maintain a faint sense of their presence up to 500 meters away. Additionally, you can activate any of your inscribed runes mentally. Should you move beyond a 1000-meter range, your runes will become dormant but will reactivate upon your return to the area.  
The aesthetic of your runes can be customized to any form of symbology or lettering you prefer.  
Sage  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Magus  
You can now “tune” your runes with great precision, allowing you to carefully control the energy or matter drawn from your pocket dimensions. Instead of just releasing raw energy or matter, you can shape and direct this energy in specific ways that interact smoothly with the physical world. For example, you can summon projections with the rune acting as its core. For instance, air from a compressed air dimension could form into a swirling, semi-autonomous air elemental, capable of blocking attacks, knocking objects aside, or creating gusts to carry items.  
You can also enhance the effects of your runes by placing them close together to create a feedback loop, where they interact to produce stronger or combined results. For example, two runes tuned to gravity might create a stronger gravitational field together, making objects feel heavier or move more slowly within a certain area. If a rune drawing from superheated air is placed near a compressed air rune, the combined effect could create a powerful blast of high-speed, heated air capable of burning or cutting through obstacles.  
Through a “symbiotic rune system,” you can also link your runes in clusters, so they work together to create ongoing effects. As long as you are within 1000 meters, these clusters can maintain their power for extended periods. A cluster of compressed air runes could form a kinetic barrier that blocks or slows down incoming attacks, while a group of gravity runes might create a small area with stronger gravity, making it harder for enemies to move or escape.  
You now no longer have a limit to how many runes you can have active at once.

Songbird  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:Canary  
Possessing a remarkable natural talent for vocal expression, your voice has the uncanny ability to captivate anyone who hears it. As you sing, those listening are subtly altered; their minds are influenced, making your voice even more soothing and appealing to their ears. You have a memetic understanding of when someone is actively listening to your singing. Once contact is established, your voice serves as a link into their mind; the longer they listen, the deeper you can reach. Within a matter of seconds, you gain access to their surface thoughts and emotions, allowing you to read and even alter them. After a few minutes, you have the capability to delve even deeper, accessing and altering their memories. This also grants you a multitasking ability that scales with the amount of people who are listening to your singing, allowing you to process high amounts of information while maintaining a constant focus on your singing.  
Your abilities can work through technology at a weakened level; people will need to listen to you for at least half a minute before you can read and alter their surface thoughts.  
Canary  
Cost: 8 SP  
Your power allows you to be an exceptionally skilled singer, but also affects those who hear your singing. Those who hear your singing become susceptible to suggestions. You do not have an innate ability to tell when someone is under the influence of your Master ability. This may inadvertently cause words meant for normal conversation to turn into power-enforced commands.  
Anyone may give suggestions, with a broad range of applications. Suggestions may induce physical reactions such as nodding one's head or compel involuntary actions. Suggestions such as "calm down" can even soothe an affected subject in dangerous situations.  
The power's potency is minimized when transmitted through technology.

Shard Insight  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:(Trump/Thinker) Power Sight  
Your ability to see powers has evolved to be able to completely see and perfectly understand the inner works of Shards and Powers. As a result, any power that allows you to copy powers by touch now works by line of sight up to a max distance of 100m. This power only sees shard-based powers without Esoteric Knowledge and does not change how long your power takes to copy powers.

(Trump/Thinker) Power Sight  
Cost: 4 SP  
You can see what powers someone has, as well as if they're actively using it.

The Truth and Only the Truth  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Truth Serum  
In your presence, no one can tell a lie. This power is retroactive, making it that any statements said in your presence must be followed, no matter what. If someone said they will kill Butcher in front of you, they will do so, even if they don’t want to. This doesn’t magically increase their capabilities, so you can’t just have someone say they will kill an Endbringer and expect it to work.  
*Someone is Lying*  
Required:(Master) Confession  
Your power has grown. Now, you are able to choose if you wish to make it impossible to lie or to simply know whether someone is lying, telling half truths or full truths. From there, you can twist it. If someone claims to have survived a war (a truth), you can make it so that this is a lie in their head, or if someone said that they dislike fighting (a half truth), you can make it a truth and turn them into a true pacifist. This fabricates the necessary memories to make the truth make sense to the target. This doesn’t give/take away any skills, instead the memories gained will explain away on why they have/don’t have certain skills. Perhaps that while they never were in a war, they picked up fighting from the streets, or they are a pacifist due to gaining enlightenment.  
Clearing the World to One Nothing Left to Hide  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Master/Thinker) Truth Serum  
Your power’s range and area have greatly expanded to the size of 3 to 5 blocks depending on population density. It also extends to open anyone within your range of others’ truth concerning them, especially those connected to the user by parental or fraternal bonds. This, successively, reaches out to those familiar or fraternal bonds and applies it against the user and vice versa.  
A brutal version of exposure therapy and psychoanalysis. A World where lies are left behind, leaving only the Ego/Self confronting itself for its lack of acceptance.  
You gain a lengthened understanding of others’ unconscious and internally repressed truths accompanying the external truths relating to them, no matter if it’s their family or friends' thoughts or opinions concerning them. They are also incapable of lying in spirit, as your power compels them to not fall back on pretense, rationalization, or self-delusion about anything to communicate within your World and force the person to process and internalize the Truth whether their compliance is or isn't a factor. Has the consequence of permanently healing delusional mindsets, cognitive distortions, and deep-rooted rationalizations.  
*He Lies Still*  
Required:The Truth and Only the Truth  
Required:(Master) Confession  
Truth is unalienable. It is the foundation our reality is built, aids in parsing our experiences, and helps us orient ourselves.  
This is now a tool.  
You can twist the truth and lies within the hearts and minds of humanity within your World, turning a declaration into an incontrovertible truth they’ll act upon regardless of compliance, turn a lie into a truth on a dime on their innermost thoughts and beliefs, a half-lie to a truth to make it “real” on the liar’s eyes. Their minds assist with this with memories and suitable shifts in their personality.  
This exposes them to what they are to blame: Being liars. A Truth they’ll keep to the grave.  
Exposing them to others’ Truth causes them to unravel both physically and mentally by the constant incongruence between who they assume to be and who they actually are.  
What does a liar do when he’s dead?  
*Shadow Confrontation*  
Required:(Blaster/Shaker) Vicious Mockery  
Your power can now be offensively utilized, weaponizing Ego Stripping through either personally confronting the person vitriolically or diplomatically of their lies, causing both psychic and physical damage depending on the person. The more deep-rooted the lie the more severe the damage can be. Among the effects that tend to appear are: psychological feedback by tearing apart different pillars of the Ego that keep the target from seeing and internalizing the Truth such as projection, abstraction, binary identification, among others; painful stings of pain across the body reaching to outright tearing the body apart (this scales according both the target’s refusal and depth of lie), etc.  
Extreme cases of using this have the target's Ego Death as a consequence.  
*Imago Dei*  
Required: Gallant, Dean Stansfield, or Cherish  
Required:Comprehension  
Required:(Shaker/Trump) Genius Friends  
People within your World aren’t open to their personal and surrounding truths but most of all, they also understand their context and subtext close by their emotional and psychological factors; this is propped up through both a sense of clarity and sharpness guiding their path, so is finding an Imago Dei to aspire towards, letting themselves to a genuine process of Integration, it crystalizes or leads up to a genuine Individuated Self, a grounded form of enlightenment, so to speak…  
Fulfilling the power’s end goal.  
*Lifting the Dusted Veil*  
Required:Eldritch Sight  
It has been long since the Curtain of the Hidden and Unsaid unveiled itself for the world to see.  
Until now.  
You ring up the curtain to the True Shape of all Things, people are unwilling participants in this play with your World being a getaway to this reality. It plays up as an antithesis to SEP (Someone’s Else Problem), the mind’s inability to tear their gazes away from a car crash knowing the outcome and be consumed by curiosity that leaves a mark on their minds, they are urged to See what the World hides behind a veneer of secrecy, bestowing everyone within your World a perception gazing deep to anything they look around, what secrets it holds, the sins that occurred on a place, are among the many horrifyingly enthralling discoveries they will encounter within your world.  
(Master/Thinker) Truth Serum  
Cost: 10 SP  
To your vicinity, people’s uncomfortable truths about themselves are in plain sight within their mind’s eye, incapable of avoiding them, almost as if someone forces them to confront their biases and self-deception. You gain an insight into their unconscious truths and use it to your advantage or theirs if you’re more benevolent.  
When asked about something, they’ll tell you with the utmost truth as they lose their capacity to lie to themselves and others around you.  
This can be therapeutic for some as it is crushing for others.

Tsar Bomber  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:(Striker/Shaker) Bomber  
The explosive potential of your bombs has been elevated to the atomic. Your yield can now range from the smallest grenade blast to the colossal power of the Tsar Bomba, a human-created fusion bomb with a yield of 100 megatons.  
Moreover, you have acquired specific immunity to any harm when your bombs detonate. For instance you can now set off numerous of your nuclear bombs, with you in the center of explosions, without experiencing any bodily harm.  
*F.O.A.B.*  
Required:Bakuda  
The maximum range of the effects of your exotic detonations is increased to the blast-radius of the Tsar Bomba, which is 22 miles. The occasional involuntary randomness of your bombs is removed, leaving you free to decide the exact effect of each bomb, with randomization remaining an option you can select. You also gain an immunity to all exotic effects of your bombs, though you can allow yourself to be affected so that your healing-bomb fixes you as well.  
(Striker/Shaker) Bomber  
Cost: 20 SP  
Through physical contact, you possess the ability to discreetly attach an imperceptible explosive device onto individuals and objects, That only you can see. The destructive potential of the device can be precisely calibrated, spanning from the potency of a conventional military hand grenade to that of the formidable GBU-43, colloquially known as the Mother of All Bombs (\~11 tons TNT). At your discretion, you retain the capability to adjust the explosive yield at any given moment subsequent to attachment, as well as determine the desired time of detonation.  
There is no limit to how many bombs you can attach at a time.  
*Exotic Ordinance*  
Required:Bakuda  
Your touch-applied devices are no longer restricted to conventional explosions, but can release any AoE-effect you can think of. You are able to freely adjust effective radius at will until the actual moment of detonation. The maximum range of your exotic explosions is two miles, the blast-radius of a MOAB. Though while you always have at least a rough idea of what the ultimate result of a detonation will be, sometimes the exact effect will be randomized. So while you know that anything caught in the blast will be completely destroyed, you may not know if that's because the blast will make everything it touches crumble to dust or because it creates a contained singularity that sucks it all into itself.  
Bakuda  
Cost: 9 SP  
You are a Tinker whose specialization is explosives. You are able to create bombs with an incredibly wide variety of effects, not all of them lethal. You don't have complete control over what you build and sometimes don't even know what the end result will be.

Chi Master  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:(Striker/Trump/Thinker) Chi Blocking  
You can drain or give your chi to others. Giving your chi will empower and heal them, while draining the chi of others will harm or even kill them while strengthening yourself.  
At the cost of a whole person’s worth of Chi, you can bring back the recently deceased. They will be weakened and require daily chi from you for at least a week.  
Note that giving your chi will weaken you, and if you don’t have enough chi you will die.  
(Striker/Trump/Thinker) Chi Blocking  
Cost: 8 SP  
You have an instinctive knowledge of a pseudospiritual energy that flows through peoples' bodies. You can instinctively tell how this energy flows through their bodies.  
By imbuing your hands with this pseudospiritual energy you can apply certain effects to your opponents through the pseudospiritual energy flow's pressure points. This includes deactivating their powers, putting them into an unconscious state, putting them in a suggestive state, making them intoxicated, making them completely lose all concept of time, etc.

Genie from Wish.com  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Stranger/Thinker) Discount Genie

Victor  
Cost: 5 SP  
You are a skill thief, with the ability to absorb the practical expertise of anyone you spend time in the presence of. The skills you can absorb can be increased by things such as eye contact or physical contact, with each connection increasing the breadth and depth of what you are able to steal, whether a specific skill or a target's general skill set.

[Copenhagen Interpretation](#bookmark=id.u18d581vquew)

The Old  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Precognitive Combat  
Sean Connery, Baba Yaga, The Punisher, The Boogeyman, The First Hunter, The Big Boss, Doctor Van Helsing—what do all of these names have in common? They are all elderly individuals working in professions where people die young. Now, you can claim to be their equal (or even surpass them by cheating using powers). You can't lose in any skill-based combat, whether it involves cold weapons like swords, shields, even armor, or hot weapons, whether they are old, new, or Tinker-tech. Everything about you, including your limbs, is to be considered lethal and would almost certainly be banned by the Geneva Convention. Not even precogs on the likes of Cortessa or Ziz can match your skill\! Just don't expect this to save you if they drop a nuke on your head.  
(Thinker) Precognitive Combat  
Cost: 6 SP  
You are a Combat Thinker, specializing in the role of a one-(wo)man army, excelling in both one-on-one and one-against-many combat scenarios. Your ability to anticipate actions before they occur enables you to perform mind-boggling feats of finesse and skill. Among those who rely on conventional methods, you are considered the pinnacle of combat prowess including tactics, strategy and skills, making even individuals like Uber and Victor appear somewhat gimmicky in comparison. Additionally, you attain a nominal level of fitness(if you don't already possess it or a superior level) and an understanding of how to best train and maintain your body health.

Comprehension  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required: (Thinker) Omniscient, or (Thinker) Vision  
You no longer gain just an answer to any questions you pose, instead you gain true comprehension and understanding of all answers you get.

This knowledge cannot harm you in any way, regardless of its nature.  
(Thinker) Omniscient  
Cost: 25 SP  
You can answer any question anyone asks you, except that if you don't have Negentropy you can't answer how to solve/negate entropy. You can ask yourself questions and automatically know the answer to any question asked of you, even if the answer to that question harms you.

Cost: 35 SP  
You can simulate any scenario you can come up with.

Unseen  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Stranger) Unnoticeable  
People won't notice you even if you attack them now. Nothing you do or say will get them to acknowledge your existence. They will still be able to perceive you, but they will not be able to act on that knowledge consciously. They will subconsciously move away to avoid hitting you, and will not question why they are suddenly hurt if you attack them, in fact they will not even act on the fact that they are hurt.  
Together, We are forgotten  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Stranger) Unnoticeable  
You can now share and make people immune to the effects of your power.  
(Stranger) Unnoticeable  
Cost: 10 SP  
People won't notice you unless you attack them. You could go the the bathroom on their food, and while they wouldn't eat the food, they wouldn't acknowledge your existence. They will know something is up though, since there was poop in their food.

Computronio  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Neural Network  
You possess access to a network comprising 768 Nodes (increasing to 1024 with Negentropy). For every 8 unallocated nodes, your thinking speed escalates by 25% in an additive manner. Nodes are designed to store approximately 5 Petabytes of information.  
Thinker powers consume a number of nodes roughly equivalent to their SP plus one (e.g., Thinker 2 requires 3 Nodes, Thinker 3 requires 4 Nodes). Your maximum budget for a Thinker power is 25 nodes.  
You can also create Tinker powers that starts with an empty database; You have to fill it with data and nodes according to the square of their SP (e.g., 0 requires 1 point, 3 requires 9 points). Your maximum budget for a Tinker power is 81 nodes.  
Hybrid ratings ('Tinker/Thinker 3') generally tend to cost higher than simple abilities but less than the sum of their parts.  
Network Expansion  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Neural Network  
Your mind is a fascinating, self-expanding construct, designed to evolve over time. Every week you gain an additional 16 (32 with negentropy) nodes.  
As your mind expands, you can handle increasingly complex tasks, analyze data at even higher resolutions, and seamlessly integrate new abilities, making it more versatile with each passing week.  
(Thinker) Neural Network  
Cost: 35 SP  
You have access to a network of 512 Nodes (768 with Negentropy) that can be used for several purposes. For every 16 unallocated nodes, your thinking speed is increased by 25% additively.  
Nodes can be used to store approximately 2.5 PB (petabytes) of information, this includes memories. One Node is sufficient to store a perfect snapshot of your brain.  
Nodes are also able to be grouped into a Module, this allows them to be programmed to perform various functions like keeping track of time, automatically creating a backup of your brain, processing your vision to parse any text and store it in a node, and more. If it can be done with a computer, it can be done with a module. One node has roughly the same processing power as a high end server.  
You can also use Nodes to create a Cluster, this allows them to host Thinker powers. THe power uses a number of nodes equivalent to the square of its rating (Thinker 2 takes 4 Nodes, Thinker 3 takes 9 Nodes, and so on). Your maximum rating is 9\. The powers can only use information gathered from your own senses, including any power-granted senses.

Klondike Bar  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Thinker/Master) Bribery Makes Everything Easier  
Your Bribery power's master component is greatly empowered allowing you to successfully bribe more people for far, far, cheaper than it normally would. Yes, including getting people to kill each other over ice cream bars, although with something that extreme it would take a significant amount of convincing for most people to even consider.  
(Thinker/Master) Bribery Makes Everything Easier  
Cost: 2 SP  
You gain a thinker ability to discern what would be the optimal bribe to convince a person or group to do a particular task for you. And a minor master ability to get said target to at least listen to your attempts to convince them to take the bribe in question and also not get second thoughts if they do go along with it.

Perfected Past Sight  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Past Sight  
Your viewing now applies retroactively. Any location or person that you have seen during your viewing, you can now apply this power on too. The restriction of it having to have been within the past day has been lifted.  
(Thinker) Past Sight  
Cost: 12 SP  
You are capable of viewing the past with perfect clarity, with the typical shard blindspots. This can be directed at a specific person that has been in your line of sight or a location that you have been at, within the past day. Time can be slowed down, paused or sped up during this viewing.

Magnetics, Daughter\! This is how they work\!  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Shaker/Blaster) Magnets, Son\! How do they work?  
You gain a Tinker specialization in magtech and related fields, allowing you to, among other things, expand your range using mobile range extenders and automate the field creation/operation  
*Electromagnetic Miracles*  
Required:Electro-Magneto  
Your Tinker specialization has now expanded from magtech to cover every possible aspect of electromagnetism with almost no restrictions. As a tinker, you are to the electromagnetic force what Hero was to wavelength manipulation.  
You can construct Tinkertech that creates illusions by manipulating electromagnetic light or build magnetic monopoles, advanced masers, absurdly efficient electromagnetic generators and even weapons that can negate the electromagnetic force entirely in a small area, destroying matter itself.  
Through your incredible grasp of this fundamental force of the universe, there is now little you cannot eventually do under the scope of electromagnetism with enough time, effort and materials.  
(Shaker/Blaster) Magnets, Son\! How do they work?  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can create and shape magnetic fields within a 100-meter range, field formation is instantaneous, powerful, and extremely precise. You are limited only by your concentration, focus, ingenuity, materials at hand, and the space available within your range. This can be used for applications such as manipulating, compressing, and launching metal, or anything else you can get to work through magnetic field interactions. This comes with a passive defensive shield that will protect you fully from shockwaves, and deflect magnetic attacks such as metals, electricity, or plasma.

[Memetic Me](#bookmark=id.h14l01txion4)

Multiversal Warping  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:(Shaker/Mover) Dimensional Warping  
You are no longer limited to just your universe, allowing your manipulations to cross to other universes within your local multiverse. Taking Homecoming makes this ability Omniversal given the correct medium.  
(Shaker/Mover) Dimensional Warping  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can manipulate the fabric of spacetime, allowing you to make non-euclidean regions that defy conventional physics. This would allow you to make things bigger on the inside, an endlessly looping stairway, or even a time dilation room. There is a somatic component to this power, requiring that you stretch and pull at the very fabric of spacetime with your bare hands. You may not reverse time, and you cannot cross dimensions either. The better your knowledge of a region, the higher the quality of the manipulations you do, making it almost impossible to accurately portal to a place you've never been to before. Due to your manipulation's somatic nature, complex or long-range manipulations require much more time to enact, possibly increasing by several magnitudes.

Exotic Creation  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Shaker) Baryonic Creation  
Your power of creation has now expanded, allowing you to create exotic matter from seemingly nothing. Exotic matter is the colloquial term used to describe highly "unnatural" matter that is not composed of protons, neutrons and electrons. One of the most common forms of exotic matter in nature is a so-called 'nuclear pasta', a form of structured neutronium that can only exist within the crusts of neutron stars.  
(Shaker) Baryonic Creation  
Cost: 15 SP  
The power of creation is in your hands\! How quickly you create complex matter from seemingly nothing entirely depends on the scale, complexity and your understanding of the end product. Creating a cubic foot of steel would only take moments, while an assault rifle will take minutes. However, something complex like a modern car would probably take a few hours or more, assuming you understand its inner workings.

Overclock  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Breaker/Trump) Golden Form  
You may choose to overclock your Golden Form, increasing it’s abilities and enhancements a hundred fold, but it’ll start an internal timer of 30 minutes, after which your Golden Form will turn off and become inaccessible for a period of 24 hours.  
(Breaker/Trump) Golden Form  
Cost: 30 SP  
You’ve gained the ability to change into a powerful breaker form, converting your body into a semi-solid/liquid energy with its initial form resembling you in a full body cloak of golden flames. All your abilities are massively enhanced from your previous form, a normal human would be capable of overpowering Alexandria in strength and durability, sheer speed to run from one side of the planet to the other in a minute, and a reaction time to easily handle that kind of speed. This enhancement is extended to all your abilities, including other powers. The breaker form can be confined to a single part or individual parts of your body if you wish, and switching between your normal form and breaker form will instantly heal any injury.  
Alongside this is the ability to manipulate the energy your body is made from, allowing you to freely shape it into whatever you desire such as massive hands, a large animal form, or even weapons. The energy your body produces and is made from can be expelled as powerful blasts or used to imbue any other abilities you possess to further enhance them. You can channel any abilities you possess through your energy form as if they were your own body. You also possess a secondary ability allowing you unlimited multitasking in regards to your energy form.  
You cannot access any of the abilities from the form without using your breaker form, and can choose to change the colors of your breaker form at will. The transformation between forms is instantaneous.

Fast Forward  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Striker) Rewind  
You can choose to fast forward anything you touch to a possible future state instead. You still retain the same amount of control as previous, allowing you to selectively choose how and what gets fast forwarded.  
(Striker) Rewind  
Cost: 9 SP  
You can selectively rewind the state of anything you touch, including yourself, to a previous state. You can do things such as rewinding your physical state to heal injuries or repair objects, rewinding someone’s mind to erase select portions of their memories, or even rewind someone’s entire state to resurrect them. You can selectively choose what aspects to rewind such as only physical, to restore someone to a younger and healthy body without erasing their memories, or perhaps just healing someone’s injuries they have gotten from training without removing any benefits from said training.

Clone Master  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Master) Cloning  
You are no longer limited to only cloning parahumans. You can now absorb the DNA of multiple beings, and then produce clones of them simultaneously. This allows you to create a small army of clones, each with different powers and abilities, based on the original parahumans.  
Time taken to produce clones is also shortened to 60 minutes. If Fusion Master is taken then its shortened to 10 minutes.  
Fusion Master  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Master) Cloning  
You are no longer limited to only cloning parahumans. You can absorb the DNA of multiple creatures, and then produce a single clone that is a fusion off all of them. The resulting fusion is loyal to you and is an effective ally, able to use the combined abilities of both original parahumans. There is no limit to how many creatures that can be fused at once.  
(Master) Cloning  
Cost: 25 SP  
You can absorb the DNA of a single parahuman via touch, which can be used to produce a single clone of that parahuman. You can create multiple clones of a specific Parahuman. The cloning process takes 180 minutes, and the user can only create one clone at a time. During the cloning process, minor alterations to the clone's physical appearance and power expression can be made. You have a telepathic link with the clones, allowing you to command them from afar. All clones produced retain the original's memories and are capable of acting on their own. They are able to solve complex problems and think for themselves, and are given autonomy to make their own decisions. They are still loyal to their creator, but they are not completely obedient and can act independently if they believe it will benefit the creator. You are unable to create clones from other clones.

(Breaker) Rebirth  
Cost: 10 SP  
When you die, one of this power's charges is used, bringing you back to life a month later at some safe spot. You start with one charge, regenerate one charge per month without dying, and have a maximum capacity of 5 charges.  
Revive  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Breaker) Rebirth  
You will be able to revive anywhere between 10 seconds to 1 month after dying. When brought back to life, you will appear in a safe spot.  
Immortal  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Breaker) Rebirth  
The user will be able to now gain one charge every week, and have no limit on capacity. The user can gain charges faster by being in near death situations (combat) without dying.

The Man Of Tomorrow  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Upcoming Century  
Your unparalleled skill and knowledge in invention expand even further. You now possess the ability to invent anything that is theoretically possible within a 300-year timeframe. Furthermore, your deep understanding of scientific principles and engineering concepts has been greatly enhanced, allowing you to further expand any field of technology you're working on.  
With your newfound capabilities, you can push the boundaries of innovation and create advancements that can even surpass the initial 300-year projection. As time goes on, your creations become increasingly advanced, revolutionizing technology in ways previously unimaginable.  
(Tinker) Upcoming Century  
Cost: 18 SP  
You acquire the unparalleled skill and knowledge to invent anything that is theoretically possible within a century. With a deep understanding of scientific principles, engineering concepts, and innovative thinking, you possess the ability to bring forth groundbreaking creations and technological advancements.  
Armed with this expertise, you can conceive and develop revolutionary inventions, pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in various fields. From advanced robotics and artificial intelligence to renewable energy solutions and space exploration technologies, your creative potential knows no bounds. With your visionary mind and mastery of scientific principles, you become a catalyst for progress, shaping the future with inventions that were once only dreams.

Cache  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Revolution  
You become a master at technology, you can quickly grasp the principles and applications of any Tinker Specialty you possess.  
You also gain the Tinker equivalent of any powers you purchase, as well as the ability to imbue, channel, and create tinkertech items with your abilities, such as powerful mechas you can control with incredible precision that is specifically tailored to and can utilize your powers. (If you possess Glory Girl’s power you can create a mecha that has her force fields and aura, and if you have Eidolon’s power then you can make an automaton that can gain any 3 powers at a time, etc..)  
Additionally, your Tinker Specialty can obtain permanent slots for your Tinker Powers at a reduced price. You only need to spend one-third of the normal SP cost for T1 Tinker Powers and half of the normal SP cost for T2 Tinker Powers.  
(Tinker) Revolution  
Cost: 30 SP  
You have access to every Tinker technology tree as well as understood technology dating back to the dawn of civilization(s). The closer to understood technology your inventions are the less black-boxed they are. This limit can be raised if you study and analyze your own technology or if a technology you created is reverse engineered and understood by scientists.  
You can have 3 method specializations (modular, efficiency, etc), 5 broad specializations (lasers, waves, code, vehicles, etc.), and 9 narrow specializations (clockwork automata, personal equipment, prosthetics, surveillance, etc.) at once. It takes a minute to switch between specializations.  
Note: Even if you build a replicator the created items will still be black-boxed and need maintenance.  
Note: Technology levels, your base technology level is based at least on 2010 technology and cannot be lower if you are in a world with a more primitive understanding.

Persisting Growth  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Time-Loop  
No longer does your Time-Loop carry over only information. It now carries over all personal improvements gained during a loop, no matter the origin.  
*Synchronous Growth*  
Required:Coil  
Both timelines are real and considered "experienced" by Persisting Growth, allowing you to gain all personal improvements from both timelines. For example, if you exercise in one timeline, the other timeline will benefit from it too.   
*Banked Achievements*  
Required:Stacked Move  
Your ability to loop now extends beyond personal improvements. You can carry over up to 10 different achievements into each new loop. These achievements could range from amassing $10 billion, killing a Cape, or even swapping the flag on the Moon for a Mexican one. The key benefit is that you no longer need to repeat these tasks in subsequent loops—they are automatically accomplished.  
The achievements you can bank are limited to tasks where you were the primary contributor or completed the majority of the work. For instance, if you shot Coil with a gun, in the next loop, Coil would simply drop dead with a bullet hole, without you needing to find the gun again. Similarly, if you defeated an Endbringer, you wouldn't need to recreate the conditions necessary to do so again. As long as you did the bulk of the work, such as building the weapon or imbuing it with a Sting-like effect, it will be automatically replicated in future loops.  
Multiple Save Slots  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Time-Loop  
You have five save points instead of one. You can set up an auto-save in one of the slots, by default it will save every day when you go to sleep or at midnight.  
Undo-Redo  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:Multiple Save Slots  
Instead of having a limited amount of save points, you may revert to any moment in time that you have experienced. It cannot be before you got this power unless you have Homecoming.  
(Thinker) Time-Loop  
Cost: 20 SP  
You can set a save point (in space and time) to which you will return when you die. You can only move the save point forward in time, an initial save point is created when you first gain this power. You can choose to truly die instead of returning. Your memory of past events is slightly enhanced to remember past loops.  
This power creates a real time travel loop as such it has no blind spots and cannot be detected except by other powers that manipulate the timeline.

Archmage  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required: (Trump) Arcanist, (Trump/Tinker) Artificer, (Trump/Tinker) Alchemist, or (Trump) Kineticist  
Arcanist, Kineticist, Artificer, and Alchemist are upgraded to the next level.  
Arcanist gives you access to more magic systems as well as the ability to design your own. Your energy pool and recharge rate are multiplied by 10\. Your spells are no longer limited in strength. Your Kineticist abilities are affected in a similar way.  
Artificer's enchantment cap is raised to five and you generate 6 more charges per day. Your enchantments are no longer limited in strength.  
With Alchemist, you can create potions that can have permanent effects on the drinker. Your potions can now grant powers on par with a high tier cape. You can transmute metamaterials that are more easily enchanted, or that can conduct, store, or enhance spells, as well as various power-like effects. The transmutation time is now proportional to the circle's area instead of the volume.  
With this, you could potentially destroy an Entity if you put your mind to it.  
(This doesn't give you additional abilities, only upgrades what you already have.)  
*Magic Language*  
Required:Ward Master  
Your Ward knowledge is brought to a Archmage level, extending it reaches to Hexes and Boons, Hexes focus on offence, cursing your enemies with misfortune and hindrances, bringing about setbacks and calamities. These dark incantations have a variety of effects, from impairing an opponent's physical and magical abilities to draining their decisions or magical abilities. On the flip side, Boons focus on support, bestowing blessings and advantages upon your allies. These enchantments can enhance their strengths, protect them from harm, heal and empower their abilities, and provide strategic advantages in battles.  
While Wards remain neutral and demand a Ward Stone, Hexes and Boons rely more on a sympathy link, necessitating a symbolic connection between two entities. The stronger the symbolic link, the more seamlessly they can treat as inherently connected, defying the conventional notion that things are separated by mere space.  
*Spirit Language*  
Required:Ward Master  
Required:Lower Dantian  
Your knowledge on wards has now been expanded to include application of chi, granting you the ability to make talismans and formations.  
Talismans are basically strips of paper used to cast spells with chi. Thes can produce a variety of effects such as taking lethal damage, increasing your punching power, or even setting something ablaze with fire. While this is a bit redundant and slower than your actual magic spells, talismans have the advantage of delayed activation, allowing you to set up complex traps with what is effectively a magic trip mine.  
Formations are an array of these talismans being used in conjunction with each other to cover a wider range. These are basically wards made with chi but have the benefit of not setting off a chain reaction if one of them gets destroyed. The formation still stops if one of the talismans is destroyed, it just doesn’t destroy all of them, making it an easier fix. Sadly, the multicomponent nature of formations makes it harder to link multiple formations together, with multiple talismans needed to simply act as routers between just two. It is thankfully much easier to link wards to formations, with a single talisman on the ward stone itself being all that is needed. Though, you might want to do this even if you're just linking wards, as the talismans can act as a layer of protection on the ward stone, being destroyed in its place if something happens.  
*Pill Alchemy*  
Required:(Trump/Tinker) Alchemist  
Required:Lower Dantian  
You gain the ability to use your chi to convert your potions into pills. If used by itself, the most notable benefits will be increasing storage and shelf life. Storage because pills take up less room than potions, with about ten pills taking up as much space in a bottle as one potion, with no loss in efficiency to boot. Shelf life because the transformation into a pill also makes them less vulnerable to loss from getting dropped and foreign elements contaminating their contents. This doesn’t prevent you from mixing potions either, with pills easily dissolving into any other potion you make.  
The interesting part about this comes when you consider the nature of chi. Due to its effect of increasing the user’s health it is possible to reduce or even eliminate Toxicity entirely. This isn’t fool proof; consuming sufficiently powerful potions in rapid succession will generate Toxicity regardless of the amount of chi you use in the conversion process, simply because the body can’t handle that much power at once. You could cheat this by designing a pill whose only effect is to give the user enough chi to overcome the Toxicity, but the effect won’t be instantaneous, meaning they still suffer from the effects until their body recovers. This will take longer in normal people, but those with brute, changer, or any other power that affect their body will have their recovery rate significantly boosted. In theory, someone with a strong enough body power could overcome Toxicity in less than a second with the application of chi. In practice, you’re never going to see it happen unless you happen to convince someone like Alexandria to start popping your pills like crazy. It is inadvisable to attempt this because it makes you sound like a deranged drug dealer asking to be turned into hamburger meat.  
(Trump) Arcanist  
Cost: 15 SP  
You have the ability to cast spells with a variety of magic that can reproduce the effect of non-Tinker powers. While your Shard provides you with a basic library of spells in each system and an intuitive knowledge of them, you will have to research and invent more powerful spells. Your spells will not be stronger than what Eidolon could do in his prime.  
You have a pool of energy to cast spells, you have enough to cast your most powerful spells a dozen times in a short time span. The pool takes 30 minutes to fully recharge. Permanent spells like summons, buffs, and auras reserve part of your reserve while they are active and release the energy when they are canceled or expire.  
(Trump) Kineticist  
Cost: 15 SP  
You have the ability to use psionic techniques that can reproduce the effect of non-Tinker powers. While your Shard provides you with the basics and an intuitive knowledge of how to shape the energy, you will have to research and experiment to produce more powerful results. At most, you will be as strong as Eidolon was in his prime.  
Your pool of energy is enough to use your most powerful techniques a dozen times in a short time span. The pool takes 30 minutes to fully recharge. Permanent effects like constructs, buffs, and auras reserve part of your reserve while they are active and release the energy when they are canceled or expire.  
(Trump/Tinker) Artificer  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can enchant objects with non-Tinker powers by touching them, with a maximum of three enchantments on a single object. You can choose whether the object grants the wielder use of the power, or has a variant of the power itself. This power does not allow creating Variable Trump powers like Eidolon, picking from a fixed set is possible like Othala's power. At their highest, your enchantments will be on the same level as what Eidolon could do in his prime.  
To enchant an object you need a pattern and enough charges to empower the object. Patterns can be researched by tasking your Shard to research a power, this usually takes 6-8 hours per power. You can have up to 3 (5 with negentropy) concurrent research. You gain 12 charges (18 with Negentropy) every day at midnight. Charges do not expire.  
The strength of the power is proportional to the number of charges invested, with the minimum being 3 charges. The efficiency of charges drops by 20% for every 36 charges invested into a single power up to a maximum of 216\. It takes 30 seconds to empower an object regardless of the number of charges used.  
*Administrator's Engineer*  
Required:(Trump) Manager  
You can now place your charges and enchantments into (Trump) Manager’s slots, allowing you to use the abilities directly.  
Likewise, by applying more charges to an ability, you can improve upon it, further refining it. This applies to both abilities derived from enchantments and abilities copied and stolen by others.  
Powers replicated and/or stolen by (Trump) Manager now also have their pattern automatically recorded for replication by (Trump/Tinker) Artificer. Alongside this, you can now also place powers held inside the manager into objects like you would with your enchantments.  
(Trump/Tinker) Alchemist  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can create potions from formulas which will have power-like effects when consumed and the ability to create transmutation circles to change materials into others.  
You have intuitive knowledge of how to develop new formulas. Natural ingredients as well as brewing equipment are required to create the potions. Consuming too many potions in a short amount of time creates Toxicity and can have adverse health effects on the user. The effect of your potions will fade once it's purged from the drinker's blood. Those potions are limited to powers that can be expressed physically such as regeneration, super strength, enhanced senses, invisibility, etc. At their most powerful they will be as strong as a mid-tier cape.  
You have intuitive knowledge of how to create transmutation circles. To perform a transmutation, you need to inscribe the circle on a surface and place the required ingredients inside then touch the circle to activate it. You cannot create materials with power-like properties unless you can study them, this applies to Tinker materials (like alloys). You are not limited in size however the objects must fit within the transmutation circle, at big enough sizes this means taking into account the Earth's curvature. The time to transmute is proportional to the volume.  
*Enchanting Alchemy*  
Required:(Trump/Tinker) Artificer  
You’ve gained the ability to enchant your ingredients, equipment, and/or potions to greatly empower what you can create. The more enchantments, the greater the effects.  
You may use charges to bypass the traditional requirements for the potions you make. A single charge can be used to remove the need for a transmutation circle and can transmute the ingredients for you. Two can be used to create the potions immediately upon having all the necessary ingredients.  
Potions are no longer limited solely to physically expressed powers.  
*Toxic Love*  
Required:(Tinker/Master) Love Potion  
Your mastery of alchemical brews allows you and others to better handle the buildup of Toxicity from potion consumption. When consuming potions of weaker potency, the body absorbs them with minimal to no Toxicity buildup, enabling frequent use without consequence. However, higher-potency potions still create Toxicity at the normal rate. This refined control allows you to experiment and blend weaker potions without risking rapid Toxicity buildup, even during extended use.  
Additionally, you can now create special Detoxifying Elixirs that can actively purge Toxicity from your system when ingested. When used in moderation, they effectively reduce Toxicity buildup, allowing for a reset to potion use. However, over-reliance on these elixirs may cause the body to destabilize, rapidly increasing Toxicity instead, potentially pushing the drinker into dangerous levels without warning.

Siberian  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Master) Manton  
You’ve become an unstoppable force and an immovable object. When moving you can choose to make your body an unstoppable force, capable of punching aside and piercing through any non-absolute defense. You also now have the ability to selectively choose what forces apply to you and to what parts of your body, rendering you immune to non-absolute attacks. As you have no master to project you, you can freely flicker in and out of reality allowing you to effectively teleport short distances and reconstitute yourself in the event your defenses are somehow overcome. You can selectively share these properties for a few minutes at your choice with anything and anyone you touch.  
(Master) Manton  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can create a projection that is a hole in reality, only selectively affected by physical forces and it can extend this effect to anyone and anything it's touching with the exception of yourself. The projection can be in any shape and form you wish, you can alter its form at any time when summoning it.

A Bug's Life  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required: Skitter, or Taylor Anne Hebert  
You can transform and control a massive swarm of bugs that act as a network for their brains; all the brains and nervous systems of your insects are linked together into one connected web, hosting your mind. The swarm can be manipulated to perform various tasks, such as gathering information and attacking enemies. You exist as part of the swarm, able to freely multitask and control every insect independently, allowing them to give orders with precision. When transformed, you will have to designate a select swarm of your bugs as the center of your control radius.  
The size and range of the swarm can vary depending on your skill and the available resources, but it is generally enough to overwhelm most opponents. When transforming, you can transform into any bug you can control.  
You can absorb bugs to heal, and you can even create clones of yourself by having your bugs transform into your body. You can adjust this transformation, no matter what it will be 'you'. For example, you can make them younger or older or grant them smoother skin, but you cannot swap their gender. These clones will not provide an additional control radius.  
*Skittering Life*  
Required:Skittering Legions  
You can now transform into anything you can control. The total volume of all the creatures you transform into at once can be no more than 50% more than your body’s volume.  
Relay Bug  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required: Skitter, or Taylor Anne Hebert  
Each and every one of your bugs under your control acts like a relay, increasing your max range. The further away the bug is from you, the smaller the range each bug gives. At its smallest, you will still be able to control all insects within a 1 meter radius of your controlled insects.  
*Skittering Relay*  
Required:Skittering Legions  
Anything you can control counts as relays.  
Skitter  
Cost: 6 SP  
You have total control of all arthropods within 3 to 5 blocks as well as infinite multitasking.

Hound Of Hell  
Cost: 9 SP  
Required: Bitch, or Rachel Lindt  
Your empowering abilities have reached another level, allowing you to greatly enhance any dog you come across. Instead of granting armor, you empower the dog themselves; thus, the empowered state has no time limit. In their empowered state, their bodies are optimized, becoming imposing creatures with large, streamlined bodies covered in symmetrical bony plates and spikes, augmented with a prehensile tail for increased mobility. Their abilities are enhanced, now possessing durability that can withstand sniper rounds, strength that can rip through Tungsten, speed rivalling racing cars, regeneration that can let them heal missing limbs in minutes, senses that enable them to track prey across the city, sharp claws that can shred ordinary materials, and a sonic roar strong enough to disorient or confuse foes. Their intellect is also improved, making them more formidable. Furthermore, any dog that you empower will recognize you as their alpha, developing intense loyalty towards you.  
*Lycan’s Pack*  
Required:Werewolf  
You and anyone who has been enhanced by your power will gain a boost in strength when working together. You all will also gain a minor thinker ability that increases your teamwork. When using powers together, some will gain a boost based on synergy, allowing for unique usage. Finally, they will all gain Bitch’s original power as well.  
Bitch  
Cost: 4 SP  
You can empower dogs by giving them symbiotic biological armor that vastly increases their size \- on the order of three thousand or more pounds \- grants enhanced strength, durability, agility, and an asymmetrical covering of bony plates, spikes, exposed muscles, calcified flesh, and prehensile tails. The armor only lasts a certain amount of time, however. It starts weakening after about ten minutes on average, and is usually completely defunct by fifteen minutes. You have trouble trying to socialize with humans, your power having hardwired you to better understand canines. You do not automatically control the dogs that you empower.

Dragon of Kyushu  
Cost: 16 SP  
Required: Lung, or Kenta  
You are a dragon that thrives on combat, your enemies shuddering at the thought of you and your power. You now escalate exponentially faster as you grow in strength, i.e. as you get stronger you grow in power faster and faster.  
Your Escalation now also affects all your other powers and your specific defenses, getting hit with poison will give you a poison resistance which will then begin to escalate with you, the power will also begin to very slowly lift your other powers' weaknesses, with this rate of improvement will be accelerated if those weaknesses are specifically targeted during combat.

You permanently gain 10% of the power you had during the height of your most recent escalation after you return to your base state, this 10% is counted for each stat/power individually, this also means that every transformation/escalation will give you an increase in overall power no matter how small.  
You stay in your Escalated state for up to 2 hours with no conflict unless you willingly transform back. Your size will grow in equal measure with your power, however, once you reach a certain size, around the size of Lung when he fought Leviathan, you will be able to choose whether or not you continue to grow. The growth can also be evolved out or adapted to make you only grow when you want to (if that's something you wish to happen) while being a slow change like all other power enhancements.  
Lung  
Cost: 9 SP  
You start as a low level brute but grow stronger and slowly transform into a dragon the longer you fight. You have pyrokinesis and enhanced senses that grow stronger the more you grow.

Cleave and Lacerate  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Striker/Master) Jack Slash  
The power’s restrictions regarding employing bladed objects to project cutting edges are lifted, merely performing invisible cuts and slashes as long as it is in your field of vision. This frees you from being dependent on any blade or sharp object, adjusting the telekinetic edge’s precision, cutting power, and length.  
Your parahuman intuition is more overt this time to the point where is consciously notable to yourself and others, playing interference on thinker powers by feeding false data, getting more detailed information from parahumans, enhancing your charisma against other parahumans, coincidentally creating situations that fall in your favor when it comes to conflict, or finally, obstructing hostile hosts through shard exploitation.  
*Sender and Receiver*  
Required:(Thinker/Master) Indoctrination Is Friendship  
You possess an unprecedented ability to interact and communicate with non-parahumans as if they were parahumans themselves. You will be able to obtain extensive knowledge of these individuals, enhance your charismatic traits in their presence, and even orchestrate situations that work in your favour when faced with conflict.  
In addition, your power can now manipulate entire organizations' subconscious at once, compelling them to act according to your desires.

### Tier 3

(Mover/Shaker) Displacement  
Cost: 30 SP  
You have become the quintessential example of what is often called a ‘Blink’ Mover, a sub-classification centred solely around teleportation, thanks to your shard’s focus on the shifting and transportation of space.  
You can employ two distinct types of spatial teleportation. The first is a two-way ‘swapping’ teleportation in which two areas, along with any matter and energy within, are switched in location. The second is one-way teleportation; this effectively erases any matter and energy in the receiving area, replacing it with the incoming space, while creating a vacuum in the original location. For example, you could teleport away a section of air, leaving a vacuum, with that section of air then erasing and overlaying anything at the destination.  
This power has no specific range limitations, aside from standard shard constraints, allowing you to remotely teleport space around the world and even across dimensions. You do, however, have a limited total spatial volume of what you can teleport at once, equivalent to that of a sphere 1 km in radius. Within this limit, you can freely decide the dimensions of the space you wish to teleport and can teleport numerous separate areas simultaneously, though you are limited by your multitasking and overall maximum volume.  
This power is not Manton Limited and acts as an All-or-Nothing effect, capable of spatially cutting matter on an atomic level. While it can affect Endbringer flesh, Endbringer cores remain immune due to their safeguards and spatial warping properties. This power automatically accounts and compensates for factors like momentum, planetary rotational velocity, energy transfer etc.  
To aid in its use, you possess a secondary thinker ability that grants you conscious spatial awareness of everything in the area that you want to teleport from as well as the area that you wish to teleport to, though you need a clear mental image of both locations involved. This clairvoyant sense can even remotely scout out areas you have a clear awareness of. Finally, this ability also provides excellent innate finesse; fine enough that you can teleport complex 3-dimensional shapes, like cutting out a keyhole from a wall.  
*Chronal Displacement*  
Required:Epoch  
The spatial-temporal aspects of Epoch’s power — such as transporting objects to their positions up to ten seconds from the past or future and temporarily freezing them — have seamlessly integrated. You can now employ these more time-oriented spatial manipulations with the same range, volumetric area and precision as (Mover/Shaker) Displacement, significantly expanding your versatility.  
For example, you could teleport huge droves of enemies back to their positions from 10 seconds earlier or, to avoid imminent attacks, remotely teleport them to where they will be located up to 10 seconds in the future. You can also temporarily freeze vast sections of space at will, up to that of your maximum volume and ten second time limit. Do note that maintaining this stasis is a continuous use of your total spatial volume capacity.  
*Dimensional Trekker*  
Required:(Shaker/Mover) Dimension Tripper  
Your spatial and dimensional manipulation powers have merged into a cohesive whole. With (Shaker/Mover) Dimension Tripper, you can now transport large sections of space you are aware of from halfway across the world into dimensions and universes of your design.  
This ability also works in reverse, enabling you to teleport sections from your dimensions into the current universe. For example, you could teleport a region of space from a dimension where gravity is 100 times stronger or the ground is diamond. Be mindful, however, that areas of space from dimensions significantly different from the universe it is in will dissipate as the universe reasserts itself. The greater the divergence in fundamental laws, the faster the dissipation.

To complement this, your control over your teleported spaces has improved. You can "phase" these spaces, regulating how "real" they are within the current universe and preventing them from fully overlapping existing matter. This enables you to precisely manage interactions between the two overlapping spaces, ensuring only the desired effects manifest.  
For instance, you could phase a dimension where machinery does not function over enemy tech. You can also use this to purposely hold areas from other dimensions out of sync to prevent dissipation. Note that maintaining this "phasing" requires continuous mental focus.

(Stranger/Breaker) Informatio  
Cost: 40 SP  
You are attuned to the essence of information—no, more than that, you are information incarnate. Every byte, every whispered word, every pixel in an image that pertains to you forms a vast network, a web of existence you navigate with ease. You live within these threads, making homes out of the records and memories of your existence. Your awareness extends to the whispers of your name, the trace of your image, and the mere idea of you. The essence of who you are resides in the data scattered throughout the world, and this makes you more than a mere being—you are a living, breathing entity woven into the very fabric of knowledge itself.  
Your understanding of the world comes from the information it holds. When it concerns you directly, you possess complete and intimate knowledge—nothing is hidden, nothing is obscure. A mention in a conversation, a line in a database, a photograph on a screen, or a memory in someone’s mind—all these are extensions of yourself. If someone mentions you, you feel it like a vibration in the web that makes up your consciousness. Their words become another anchor point, another node in the expansive network of your existence.  
The extent of your awareness is more nuanced than mere omniscience. While you have a complete understanding of information directly tied to you, your sense stretches beyond to include anything tangentially related. If you are blonde, you gain a faint, yet undeniable, awareness of every other blonde individual in the world. Their lives do not unfurl before you as an open book, but their presence is a hum, a flicker in your perception. It’s like standing in a crowded room where only certain voices rise above the din—you hear their whispers, sense their existence, but the details are vague unless you focus your attention. You are bound by threads that extend beyond the self, connecting to the broader world in a web of faintly glowing lines.  
This power allows you to move through these connections, appearing anywhere where information about you resides. A rumor passed between lips, a photograph pinned to a wall, a digital footprint in a remote server—each of these points becomes a doorway. You do not travel through space as others do; instead, you fold reality along the lines of information. Where your name is thought of or your likeness is stored, you may manifest, a living ghost moving through the data streams of the world. To those who witness such appearances, it is as though you slip through the cracks of reality, emerging from the shadow of a mention or the reflection of a thought.

Beyond movement, you wield the power to manipulate the very essence of information. Information itself is malleable to you, like a sculptor shaping clay. You can destroy it, leaving a void where it once was. When you choose to destroy information, you can induce a Stranger effect, erasing the traces of that knowledge from reality. People forget details, files become corrupted, memories fade. The information is removed, however this doesn’t change what already happened, simple altering known history to make it that whenever information you destroyed never existed. The absence you create is more than a hole in memory; it is a shifts to accommodate the new narrative you impose. It’s important to note that you do not warp Information in the sense of altering history itself; rather, you manipulate the knowledge and memories of others, subtly adjusting their perceptions so that they align with the narrative you create.

Your nature as living information means you are not bound by a singular identity. You can graft new information into your very being, shaping yourself according to the knowledge you possess. If you decide to adopt the information that you are a ginger, then you gain the same semi-awareness of all gingers as if this trait had always been yours. Your awareness extends to those who share that characteristic, creating a faint hum in your perception of every ginger person in existence. In the same way, you can graft other aspects—traits, experiences, skills, even entire histories—transforming yourself with each new piece of information you integrate.  
However, you are limited by the physical reality you inhabit. You cannot hold contradictory truths within yourself simultaneously; if you are currently a ginger, you cannot also be blonde at the same time. But this limitation doesn’t bind you entirely. Instead of discarding contradictions, you store them within a mental vault, like files archived for later use. You can switch between these traits, activating or deactivating them as needed. If a situation requires you to adopt a different appearance or characteristic, you can draw upon the stored information, effectively rewriting your own existence. To the outside world, this change is seamless—people perceive you as if you had always been this way, with reality subtly adjusting around the new narrative.  
This means that while your external appearance or traits may shift, others will not notice any inconsistency. They will remember you as a blonde if that is what you choose to be, even if you had been a ginger the moment before. Photographs, memories, even written records will warp to align with your current state, ensuring a complete integration into the fabric of reality. You can shift from being a seasoned warrior to a charming socialite, and the world will remember you accordingly. It’s as if the very history around you is rewritten to match your current self, smoothing over any discrepancies.

Your ability to graft information is not limited to physical traits. Skills, experiences, and even personal relationships can be absorbed into your being, becoming a part of your new self. You could integrate the combat techniques of a master martial artist, the scientific knowledge of a renowned researcher, or the memories of a seasoned traveler. These aspects become part of your identity until you choose to store them away, allowing you to seamlessly adapt to different roles and challenges. When you assume the knowledge or skills of another, it feels as though you’ve always possessed them, your body moving with the instinctual ease of long-practiced motions.  
You have no fixed form, no unchanging nature. Instead, you are defined by the sum of the information you have chosen to integrate, and the echoes of all the selves you have stored. This makes you as fluid and adaptable as the information that defines you, always changing, always evolving, yet anchored in the awareness of every aspect that has ever been part of your existence.  
In a sense, you are both a storyteller and the story itself—reshaping the narrative of who you are and what you can be, bending reality to match your chosen role. Those who encounter you might think they know you, but that knowledge is always subject to change, always malleable. You walk through the world as a living enigma, a presence that is both ever-shifting and eternally present, defined by the information you hold and the secrets you choose to become.

(Master/Trump) Endbringer Engine  
Cost: 40 SP  
To the inhabitants of Earth Bet, you have been given perhaps the most terrifying power to exist, the one power to create Endbringers.  
However, while you possess the power to create Endbringers, the power is not quite as potent as its most notable user.  
Thus, you have been given the ability to create completely loyal monsters that start off weaker than their brothers and sisters. Each Endbringer you create will start off with a core and enough spatial and dimensional folding energy to create the standard folding spatial flesh that all Endbringers use to protect their cores.  
These weaker Endbringers will start off with roughly 30 sp worth of power and can handle a couple of strikes from their fully grown brothers and sisters, but not much more.  
They will then improve over time, growing bigger, stronger, and more durable at the rate of roughly 1 sp a month until they are fully grown and can match the strength of Behemoth and Leviathan (roughly 60 sp). You have complete control over the abilities they spawn with and how they will evolve over time.  
A fully grown Endbringer may be given any group of shard-based powers that total to 60sp that is not a power-granting or power-growing ability. Any power selected can be scaled up or down according to its chosen SP, so long as the total of all powers given to an Endbringer does not exceed 60 sp. Esoteric Knowledge allows an Endbringer to be given non-shard-based powers.  
However, the construction of each Endbringer is extremely energy and processing intense, meaning that, while you start with an available slot, only 1 additional (or replacement) Endbringer can be made every month (can be reduced to a week with Negentropy) and only 7 can be alive at the same time. Also, if you spawn too many Endbringers in total without Negentropy, you run the risk of completely depleting your shard.  
*Three Times the Charm*  
Required:(Master) Friendbringers  
Your Friendbringers and Endbringer Engine have fused and increased your number of starting Endbringers to 3 and your total number of Endbringers to 10\.  
*Improved Endbringers*  
Required:Improved Friends  
Due to the fusion between Friendbringer and Endbringer Engine the final strength of your Endbringers is raised to 80SP (however the growth rate is still 1sp per month).  
*Endbringer Cycle*  
Required: (Breaker/Trump) Cronus, (Brute) Typhon, (Changer) The End-Becomer, Hero Killer, City Killer, or Hope Killer  
Your cores' innate ability to empower one another has built upon itself, harmonizing and empowering itself.  
You can now reassign your and your Endbringers' cores as you wish, with each core drastically empowering with the power of the one who possesses it. You can reassign the cores to either yourself or your Endbringers in any combination.  
You may also choose to fuse cores together, tripling the effect per core but likewise reducing the amount of cores they have available and making them more vulnerable.  
*An End To All*  
Required:Advent of the End  
Required:King of the End  
Your ability to summon Endbringers has been further enhanced by the sheer scale of energy you now produce through your cores. Now, not only can you freely transfer cores and energy between your Endbringers but all of your Endbringers are now summoned fully grown.

To make matters worse for your enemies, outside of just fusing with your Endbringers, you can now freely transfer the abilities of your Endbringers between cores (including your own), allowing you to swap abilities between Endbringers and between Endbringers and yourself should their cores still exist.  
Be mindful that fusing cores still produces a tripling of energy production but comes at the cost of reducing the amount of cores that are available and making you and your Endbringers more vulnerable.

[(Stranger) Shroud](#bookmark=id.el7v3zfrjqk)

(Thinker/Master) Burning Bridges  
Cost: 30 SP  
You see glowing strings coming out of everyone, those strings connect to everyone that a being has interacted with. Looking at the strings gives you insight on those connections, like whether the connection is friendly, hostile, or nonexistent, or things like when it started or why it ended.  
Through those strings you can doom a connection, you can decide what will be the outcome but not how it will be achieved or you can leave the outcome as random, the outcome could be something like "Being B decides to kill Being A" or "Being A ends their friendship with Being B by destroying their family heirloom", or even "Being B kills Being A fiance and Being A triggers with the power to raise undeads". How it happens is by Being A and B and every being that was/is around them in the past and present having their decisions and actions subtly influenced in a way that achieves the desired outcome. You decide to doom Being A and Being B friendship and sometime later Being B discovers their significant other has been having an affair with Being A, resulting in that friendship ending.  
Touching someone allows you to see and interact with their strings even when they are on the other side of the world, and gives you access to their connection to those they haven't interacted with. You could make the entire world hate a single person and no one would even know it was you.

[(Trump/Master) Chrysalis](#bookmark=id.x3o8ziag1ljs)

(Tinker) Clarketech  
Cost: 35 SP  
Your Shard held a very important purpose, that being collecting and storing data on technology and tinkertech that has broken previous cycles and could break future cycles. This was obviously never meant to be distributed in a cycle without heavy restrictions. Oops. As a result, you hold a Tinker specialty unlike any other, the incredibly broad and potent specialty of Clarketech, technology so advanced that it is indistinguishable from magic.  
Machines hidden away in pocket dimensions creating holographic interfaces in the air serving as the equivalent to smartphones, zero-point energy-powered flying broomsticks, nanotech-based healing potions, and multidimensional structures are just the tip of the iceberg as you begin making technology that blurs the line between the possible and impossible.  
Negentropy enables you to make use of negentropy in your own Clarketech.  
*Clericus Techno-Magica*  
Required:Yes, Techno-Magica.  
Required:Seeker of All That is Supernatural  
There is technology so advanced it is indistinguishable from magic. Then we have magic so analyzed it is simply science. Now we have YOU, a living nightmare for any entity’s cycle. You don't simply use physical and life science as a supplement to magic, you use magic as a supplement to them.  
To turn magic into standard physics and back into magic again is to play God with reality itself. No, let me rephrase that. It is to MAKE Gods and use them as glorified USB sticks. Even if your tinkertech is white-boxed, it is so advanced and esoteric that you might as well speak Klingon to a caveman. You don’t blur the line between the possible and impossible, you break it apart and use it as toothpicks.  
You can make white holes for use in guns, manufacture exotic matter in 3D printers, and turn people into living energy to put them into computers that exist outside of spacetime. Worst of all, you can actually “detain” entities. This is why you are the entities nightmare. The height of your technology could trap an entity in an interdimensional net where eons could pass in but mere instants. Needless to say, you should make sure that the entities never find out about this, at least before you make “preparations”.

(Trump) Shard Supply Store  
Cost: 40 SP  
You have an endless selection of powers in an archive of sorts. These powers are standardized components instead of finished products and can’t be used by themselves. You have the ability to fuse, modify, and forge these components together, creating greater powers from lesser shards.  
You can hold onto and use a limited number of these constructed powers at once or grant them to other people.  
In order to swap powers you must either deconstruct a power or grant it to another person.  
Your power will in time construct new components to replace any given away.  
If you focus on making the strongest power you can it will be equivalent in strength to a tier 3 weaker than Shard Supply Store and completely fill your capacity for powers but if you focus on quantity above all else you will be able to construct around forty powers equivalent to low to mid-level tier 1 powers.  
The construction of Trump powers follows different rules as Shard Supply Store does not directly allow the construction of powers that permanently alter its own rules or permanently connect to, copy, steal, or create other powers as a way to sidestep Shard Supply Store's limited capacity for powers, temporary or limited effects are allowed though. Powers are created while under the effect of an alteration to Shard Supply Stores rules and the effects of those powers are eliminated when the effect ends and can’t be given to others.  
*Abzu*  
Required:(Mover/Shaker) Nexus  
All the shards that make up (Trump) Shard Supply Store are now located in your dimension, giving you access to your own Shardspace. You can directly interact with all of these shards and your shard components now bud, grow and develop like normal shards. You're capable of modifying these shards to a limited extent and no longer have the same strict limits concerning Trump-related powers as before, allowing you to permanently copy, create and steal other powers. These actions will lead to new shards forming in your Shardspace.  
You still have limitations with your capacity to express constructed powers but these have been eased and will further lessen over time. You possess the same limits as before in terms of the maximum strength of your powers but you can now wield three powers at once instead of just a single Tier 3 power before filling your capacity. Similarly, the maximum number of low to mid-level Tier 1 powers you can wield at once has also tripled. Note that using too many powers at once as well as wielding excessively potent powers will lead to your shards quickly running out of energy unless you possess Negentropy.  
When giving powers to others, the shards remain in your dimension and so you retain full control, allowing you to influence them as you desire. Your relationship with your shards will always be positive, the shards themselves completely loyal to you. When you're using them, they will give significant leeway with your abilities and loosen restrictions. In time, you could grow and develop into something akin to that of an Entity.

(Shaker/Thinker) Be the Butterfly effect\!  
Cost: 30 SP  
At any time, you may enter a completely accurate simulation of the past created by your power; however, there is no past version of you in this simulation. Despite this, your presence is remembered, and any effects you had on the world at that point are maintained. You may choose to simulate any time within the last year. The simulation automatically ends if enough time passes in the simulation to reach the time you created that specific simulation. No time passes in the present while you are in the simulation. You enter this simulation in the past of the location you were at in the present if that space is unoccupied; if it is occupied, you appear in the nearest empty space. You are free to move around to any location in the simulation even across the universe or local multiverse, and if you end the simulation, you appear in the nearest empty space to the location you were at in the simulation. Being killed in the simulation automatically ends it returning you to the present unharmed.  
You may interact with the simulation with your body and powers, with everything and everyone within reacting just as the original would to anything you do. Changes you make to the simulation ripple out and affect the present within a few city blocks of your exit point, as if what you did in the simulation actually happened in the past.  
For example, if you kill or save the life of somebody in the "past", but their body isn’t within a few blocks of your body in the present, then nothing happens to them. This can’t be used to create temporal clones of people, so if you trap someone in a location they would not be at in the present and end the simulation at that location, but the original's body isn’t nearby in the present, then they won’t remember being trapped there or interacting with you at that time, and there won’t be a copy of them at that location.

(Breaker/Shaker) Reality Sculptor  
Cost: 40 SP  
You have absolute control over reality within a personal radius of 250 meters. You can manipulate matter and energy at will, essentially creating or transforming anything you can imagine into existence.  
You can also create sentient beings, constructs, and even alternate versions of yourself or others. You have inherent knowledge and understanding of all matter, energy, and even conceptual beings and can instantly create or manipulate them as you please.  
You can take a form analogous to a visual representation of an infinitely complex Mandelbrot set.

(Stranger/Master) Self-Inserting for Days  
Cost: 40 SP  
You can retroactively insert yourself in anything or anyone's story. If you wanted, everyone would think that you are the Hebert's youngest child. Or maybe you were always the president, even though you are clearly a minor. Cauldron? Of course you know about them, you were there in their founding. Want to be a movie star? You are, you just started that movie, did you not? Can I get an autograph? Whatever new “truth” you decide, the world will change to accept it: paper trail will be created for your convenience, statues for your glory, even the crater you made when you totally-one-shot an Endbringer. This affects everyone in the world. You can dismiss any narrative whenever you want, and no one will notice you leaving.  
PS: Just because everyone believes you did something doesn't mean you actually did. So when you convince the world that you killed Scion, do try to act surprised when he shows up to save a kitten or something.  
*Works In Progress*  
Required:Brand & Bond  
Your self-insertion has become streamlined, allowing you to ‘save’ various false histories within the bond. Each of these can be reapplied as easily as thinking, exactly as you left them, automatically filling in what has happened since you stored it.

(Breaker/Shaker) Hellfire  
Cost: 40 SP  
Flames can only burn so hot. The highest temperature recorded is two trillion kelvins. A supernova can exceed 100 billion degrees, and you're hotter than that.  
Your body temperature has a secondary breaker effect that can be manipulated as a sort of field to contain your heat, extending upwards of 100 meters.  
Your heat is enough to even start in the deconstruction and softening of Endbringer cores, very likely to even turn an Endbringer into nothing more than a gas.  
Your range is as your eye can see, and your abilities mean you are completely immune to the very idea of heat. No amount of heat can scar or burn you. Your infernos are all under your control.  
You can scale this temperature down.  
You have no brute or breaker powers allowing you to survive extremes, but you are immune to any malignant effects heat might cause to your health. This includes smoke from fires.

(Brute/Shaker) Seed of Yggdrasil  
Cost: 40 SP  
You are a seed of the tree that holds the worlds together. You have immense control over the entire Kingdom Plantae. All plants of your choice naturally flourish and provide endless bounty within 1000 miles of your location.

Within 100 miles of your location, you can force plants to grow in unnatural locations; blanket an entire city in green algae, grow an oak tree in the middle of an office, etc. The speed you can cause plants to grow in this range is fast enough for entire trees to grow within minutes.  
Within 10 miles of your location, you have absolute control over all plant life. You can grow entire redwood trees faster than a blink of an eye. Any plant within this range can be used to express any of your other abilities. You can grow plants within people to gain access to their powers and control their actions. You are no longer limited to terrestrial plants in this region; you have free reign to combine, alter, or create brand-new plants within this area.  
You have a Thinker ability that allows you to sense plants within your range relative to your level of control and a level of multitasking to match. You can interdimensionally connect the roots of your plants, allowing you to travel between them at your leisure; the interdimensionality of your roots can be extended to singular plants within your absolute range, allowing you to bypass barriers and other insurmountable defenses.  
You can assume the properties of plants in any combination. At a minimum, you have a brute rating that grants you the strength to treat a pair of redwoods as mere chopsticks. Your durability resembles that of the cumulative durability of the plants within your absolute range. By adopting the properties of plants, you can grow your body into various shapes and sizes. So long as there are plants in your absolute range, you can recover from any injury that doesn't destroy your Corona Pollentia.

(Brute) Unstoppable Force  
Cost: 25 SP  
The user possesses immense physical strength and stamina. They can lift and throw objects with ease, and their punches and kicks are incredibly powerful. Their strength is so great that they can flatten entire countries in minutes. Their stamina allows them to continue fighting for years without rest, making them a force to be reckoned with in any battle. A single punch can destroy most of the defence an Endbringer has, nearly reaching its core.

[(Breaker/Trump) Golden Form](#bookmark=id.zgjk846ynwjg)

(Shaker) Same Day Delivery\!  
Cost: 25 SP  
You have the ability to summon raw materials in a radius of 50 feet around you. The things you can summon can be any raw materials you can think of, as long as they are physically capable of existing; this means you would have to work with any metamaterials created by Tinkers before your power accepts them as viable for summoning. Notably, you can't summon finished products with this, but you can summon the component materials.  
This power is hard to weaponize, but you can be creative, such as summoning mercury on top of someone, dropping a gold anvil on someone's head, and so on. Go forth and solve resource problems forever, for yourself or others.  
*Amazan*  
Required:(Shaker) Baryonic Creation  
No longer are you limited to summoning just raw materials, or taking hours on end to make a jet. As long as it was in your radius of 50 feet, you can recreate it instantly. You can make modifications to the stuff you make, but it is suggested you only try if you understand what you are doing.

(Mover/Breaker) Time Out\!  
Cost: 35 SP  
You can manipulate how fast time flows for you, in either direction, as much as you want. In other words, you can speed your perception and movement up to the point where time appears stopped, or slow it to the point where years pass in minutes, or more. You can interact with objects normally, as though they weren't frozen, or you can choose to have objects simply refuse to move. Strength is not increased despite your speed, but you can apply your normal force multiple times in a row for roughly the same effect. You are not able to rewind time with this power. If you speed up your perceptions, your aging is slowed to account for it in a way that you age as though the appropriate amount of time passed, instead of however much you experienced. If you are about to die, this power automatically stops time for you.  
   
(Thinker/Trump) Sylar  
Cost: 40 SP  
You can instantly learn and understand the workings and mechanics of anything, understand the complexity and exactness of organisms, objects, etc. without the need for long-term or special education regardless of how simple or complex. This only helps with understanding the underlying mechanisms of the thing in question, it doesn't give any skills you didn't already possess. Your shard obscures your ability to learn anything related to The Entities such as the workings of the Cycle but with enough time or if you have a good relationship with your shard, you can understand their workings.  
By cutting into the brains of Parahumans to see and feel their Corona Pollentia and Gemma, you can understand how their power works, how to use them, and the best way to utilize them. You can even apply some minor adjustments to them.

(Brute) Immovable Object  
Cost: 25 SP  
The user's skin and body are completely invulnerable to damage of any kind, making them utterly invincible. This power is so extreme that it even negates other all-or-nothing effects, such as the sting. The user can withstand attacks from even the most powerful parahumans and villains, and is practically indestructible. This power also makes the user immune to being thrown around or knocked back by any sort of force or attack, rendering them virtually immovable.

(Stranger/Master) Observer  
Cost: 25 SP  
You no longer exist in reality, and cannot be seen or attacked by anyone, including shards, Endbringers, and even Entities.  
You can manifest an invisible phantom at any location on the planet that can interact with the world.  
   
(Shaker/Thinker) Ouranos  
Cost: 35 SP  
You gain the ability to manipulate all oxygen within a 3-mile radius sphere around yourself, up to the Atomic level. With powers of notable specificity aside (Cocytus being specified to Ice only for example but a normal Water Bender isn't specific enough) you are the absolute authority when anything oxygen-based is involved, from air to water to certain acids, even with people up to 10 times your power.  
You gain a secondary Thinker ability which gives you knowledge (position, Bonds, and things directly interacting with it, like people walking through air for example) of every Oxygen atom within your range.  
This ability inherently lacks the usual Shard Manton Limit, allowing you to do things such as take or add oxygen to/from people or control them using their blood, etc.  
Notable uses of this power include weather control in both the air and water involved, water manipulation (all forms) like the creation of Tsunamis and hyper-compressed water attacks, popping heads by filling them with oxygen, unbinding every Oxygen atom in your range creating a 6-mile diameter sphere of desperately unstable atoms, splitting or fusing the atoms in your range.  
Your best attacks, from world-changing weather phenomena made by your power to nuclear detonations made by you splitting or fusing oxygen atoms, easily damage/destroy Endbringer, and do significant damage over large areas to even Entities.

(Master/Trump) Gestation  
Cost: 35 SP  
Every Parahuman you make physical contact with has their Shard controlled by your own. This effectively means you can add or remove restrictions to the power of those under your control, or even shut their powers down entirely\! The longer this effect lasts the more the Target will find their willpower drained to become little more than a puppet to your will. You are able to control the amount of willpower that is drained from those under your control and how subtle your influence over them is. This control can be broken by having or being close to a Trigger Event or if their connection to their Shard altered drastically (Bonesaw or Panacea's work for example).  
*Fae Contract*  
Required:(Trump) Oberon  
Required:(Trump) Faerie Queen  
Required:Debt  
By utilizing Elfame and Debt, you can forge contracts with your cohorts. This process requires a more direct involvement on your part, but in exchange, contractors receive enhanced powers from Elfame's collection. These agreements are bound by contracts that specify certain conditions, with them being subordinate to either the fae's rules or the deal's. Should a cohort fail to follow these instructions and/or rules as required, they risk losing something of great value to them, in addition to the powers granted.

(Breaker/Shaker) Embodiment of the Supernova  
Cost: 35 SP  
You are able to transform into a person-shaped supernova, and in this state, you possess almost complete control over plasma and the ability to create a near-endless amount of it. You can create and manipulate plasma that is over a billion degrees Celsius and fire concentrated beams of plasma, along with creating and directing seas of plasma, with a mere thought.  
You also gained immense control over gravity and radiation. Your gravity manipulation allows you to condense matter into black holes. Your control over gravity is such that you can prevent black holes from affecting matter. Your control over radiation is such that you can prevent others from being affected by your breaker state. create illusions by manipulating visible radiation and tapping into communications that use radio waves, and so on.

(Shaker/Changer) Cocytus  
Cost: 35 SP  
You have the ability to become, create, and manipulate ice; your body is naturally in a state of being a man made of ice, though you always look human.  
This power allows you to ignore physical attacks by shattering around them, regrowing your ice body, or manipulating your body around the attack. Your body instinctively becomes ice when attacked; you can fight this.

You can create ice from nothing for up to half a mile in a sphere around you and freeze natural water for up to 2 miles (up to the molecular level). You have a secondary Thinker ability that allows you to sense all water in all its forms and create ice within your radius.  
When more energy is expended, you can drop your ice's temperature to absolute zero. Killing all energy next to your ice immediately and making your ice strong enough to tank at least one hit from an Entity-level ability. If the focus is kept on the ice, the temperature will stay down, but if not, it will rapidly heat up to its normal temperature, superheating the area around it to a temperature in excess of 15 °C.  
It will take an immense amount of energy, but if you drop yourself to absolute zero, you gain the durability mentioned along with Alexandria-level strength. But your most notable ability is that time will freeze around you for as long as you stay at absolute zero. You can move and do things in this state, but it will expend more energy to do so and freeze those you hit during this time.  
(This power will kill your shard if used for more than 24 hours and rapidly decrease its lifespan when in use. Negentropy stops these negative effects.)

(Master/Trump) The Friend Bringer  
Cost: 40 SP  
You gain the ability to summon and resend Alternate versions of Shardbearers that you meet, clones of the originals as well.  
These summons will be perfectly loyal, but will still hold their personality, they will be given a general understanding of both your world and you upon summoning. They will sacrifice themselves and their morals to protect you and do what you say. Their powers start at 50% strength and after a full 1 month of being summoned, they are boosted to 200% of their normal strength from then on (This only happens once).  
You are given a Thinker ability which allows you to perceive a mental rotating list of currently useful summons for the tasks you need done. You are given an Aura of 30 feet which counts as your range for the "meet" condition.  
Endbringers and Entities can be summoned, alternates and clones alike, but only under the condition that you touch their core for Endbringers and for Entities to seriously injure them (To summon a clone or Alt. Leviathan you would need to touch its core; to summon a clone or Alt. Scion you would need to seriously injure his real body).

Every summoning takes Shard power and requires focus to keep active after they complete their original task, summoning Endbringers is an immense drain of both Shard energy and mental focus and will do serious damage to your Shard if held too long while Entity summons will instantly drop your shard to less than 1 week of energy left and knock you unconscious for at least 1 hour, they will shatter your Shard if summoned for longer than their task takes.  
Summon's initial energy and focus requirements are substantially higher than continual summoning post-task. (Negentropy will completely nullify all the shard-based drawbacks of this power and half all mental drain).  
This power will allow you to perform this ability with any "powered" individuals in the multiverse if taken with Esoteric Knowledge or Shardless

(Shaker/Blaster) Fractal of Entropic Decay  
Cost: 35 SP  
You have in your hands the power to control what the Entities have been dreading and try to stave off to escape their inevitable demise against: the phenomenon of Entropy. In their efforts to understand it, they spend copious amounts of time researching this.  
At first, it’s viewed more as bare temperature manipulation, yet that’s further from the truth; it handles the amount of expended or unavailable energy in a system. A system in the physical sense can apply to anything but is best described as a portion of the universe where changes take place in response to a set of conditions or the environment that is then studied. It can be complex, such as a planet, or simple enough to fit in a beaker, as the liquid within a glass.

The “system” thus utilized for this power is an area of three city blocks around the user. This, being Shard-based, is quite limited in scope for the Entities’ concerns about Entropy.  
An inherent part of this ability is an extant Thinker power to perceive energy and levels of energy of any kind or measure. Once the current level of entropy is determined, you can adjust it, resulting in a change in the system. This applies to anything, such as a glass of ice, a room, or a living organism including yourself.  
A quirk of this ability is manifesting itself through a translucent stygian black energy field either as an aura or throughout your “system’s” range and even somewhat a polar opposite to Stilling: ebony rays of unlight. Some applications are somewhat analog to Stilling yet utterly antithetical in basis. Something to mull over…

The power is partitioned into three aspects: Containment, Diffusion, and Exhaustion:  
Containment is the fine control or deceleration of Entropy to a microscopic and macroscopic level, which contains activation energy (minimum amount of energy needed to initiate a reaction), among the chemical and physical phenomena that need energy to function or continue to occur. In turn, you can manipulate Entropy on a system or object to extend its timespan from its inevitable decay, violently disrupt a system’s integrity, and drastically cause system equilibrium by heating or freezing the system (or select parts).  
Diffusion is the middle ground of Entropy, in which you diffuse, absorb, and assimilate energy through macroscopic control of Entropy. This is utilized as diffusing the area’s utilized energy (including the one’s parahuman powers use, effectively negating them), absorbing it to bolster the user’s physical and dynamic abilities, or assimilating the system’s resources in mass for various uses.  
Exhaustion is the Entities’ fear, the only reason they stopped probing it: Entropy Acceleration. This is used to exhaust the system’s energy reserves responsible for structure and form causing its breakdown, destabilizing anything within your range or particular liking, and having physical and radioactive effects. For example, on a smaller scale, you can decay anything from an appliance to a house if you let Exhaustion spread, weaponizing it to an anti-energy exponentially growing through propagation to any matter or energy on contact, or infuse it into a weapon for it to deteriorate anything the weapon damages or simply graze.  
The only glaring weakness of having this power is its anathema: Negentropy. A Negentropic being can compete with you, yet depends on their energy generation/recovery: A negligible energy rate places the odds in your favour while a formidable rate of energy recovery turns this into a battle of attrition in the Negentropic being’s favour.  
*Coup de Grâce*  
Required:(Blaster/Striker) Sting  
Sting and Fractal of Entropic Decay work in conjunction with one another. You can now incorporate entropic properties into a Sting-infused projectile or power, fundamentally wearing down any energy the target uses while Sting shears through their physical or dimensional defenses.  
*Maw of a Thousand Chasms*  
Required:(Trump/Thinker) Feast  
Required:(Thinker/Trump) \[Query\] \[Response\]  
Your control of entropy is expanded, you now bring the battle to Shards and the Entities themselves. Through your vicinity and at will when establishing a Shard Connection, you can Exhaust a Shard’s energy reserves, data repository, and Shardmatter, and feed yourself with its energy and information—practically consuming the Shards’ entirety, turning you into a facsimile of a \[Predator\]. A \[Predator\] is the hypothetical predator of Entities in the circumstance of an Entity sub-species diverging to an ‘animal of prey’ pathway.  
You gain an intuitive sense of a Shard’s vulnerabilities and weak points, while also obtaining a power boost each time you consume a Shard, both on potency and power applicability manifesting itself as power expressions based on \[Data\] consumed.  
With enough time and experience, you can take the battle to Scion itself.

*The Tempest that is the Arrow of Time*  
Required:(Shaker/Breaker) Sleeper  
Sleeper and Entropic Decay harmonize into two-in-one:  
Sleeper manifests overt entropic qualities from Entropic Decay expressing itself as an “arrow of time”, meaning it gains temporal abilities within the storm, tellingly, controlling the passing or arrow of time leading to commanding equilibrium. Equilibrium is the direction of time. Aside from the subversion and control of anything within the storm’s vicinity, the three main applications of Entropic Decay are more pronounced, compounding with Sleeper’s innate manipulation of matter and energy.  
Entropic Decay gains Breaker traits from Sleeper, developing in a Breaker state turning yourself to a nebulous, gangrenous shifting mass (or humanoid shape) of concentrated entropy retaining all the abilities from both parts. Your “system” is as extensive as Sleeper’s Storm.  
*The Potter in a Vacuum*  
Required: (Shaker/Thinker) Omni-Kinesis, or (Breaker/Shaker) Reality Sculptor  
Your command of physical (and perhaps metaphysical if you possess Shardless or Esoteric Knowledge) phenomena has widened to encompass Entropy as a variable to control in the confines of your power. This additive control deepens your perceptive abilities to better appreciate the blocks in which you build and mold reality within your range and has resulted in finding a clear awareness of the particular/quantum level through understanding what a “system” intrinsically is. The depth and scale of your abilities are doubled, in such a manner you grasp both spatiotemporal and/or dimensional phenomena more easily exploiting both of your powers’ pervasiveness.  
One of the main indications of Entropy Decay’s Traits depends on the aspect you’re leaning on at the time: Containment supports and furthers your manipulation or warping abilities, Diffusion overtly sways over disseminating and absorbing energy to be inaccessible to others except yourself, Exhaustion is the most destructive trait for it degrades and breaks down energy and matter indiscriminately or selectively, effectively breaking and destroying reality where it’s focused.  
*The \[ALTERNATIVE\]*  
Required: Negentropy, or Shardless  
Containment has improved into Reversal with Negentropy or Shardless (being innately Negentropic), perpetuating and reverting the system into a prior state or simply retaining its structure through continuous preservation of energy.

(Shaker) The Ultimate Question  
Cost: 40 SP  
Your Shard contains information that is simultaneously the most priceless and worthless knowledge the Entities have. A burning desire that despite over millions of years of research, they seem no closer to getting. Your shard contains the record of the closest they have gotten to Negentropy.

The basic theory was that since the Multiverse allows for infinite variation, it should be possible to harness infinite variations of energy. Unfortunately, the act of reaching out into the multiverse was simply too energy-exhausting, meaning that they absorbed less energy than they were expending. This doesn’t mean that this \[Data\] is useless though, it just wasn’t what they were looking for. Ultimately, the information was repurposed to simulate and manipulate this energy for their own ends.  
When using this power, a large 30-centimeter silvery white ring or “halo” will manifest itself around you, affecting things within a three-block radius. By default, it appears behind your head. You can change its location around you and even its size, but it will always manifest in your vicinity. This halo, while antithetical in application, is surprisingly analogous to Stilling in basis—a point of study, perhaps.  
As stated previously, this power can be used in two basic ways known as \[Simulation\] and \[Manipulation\].  
\[Simulation\] applies a constant rate of energy to an object or phenomenon. Originally designed to simulate how the universe’s energy generation works and how to possibly increase it, it has been repurposed to allow things like a bullet ignoring air resistance and gravity to fire in a perfectly straight line. If this sounds familiar, it should. This mechanic has been further refined into what modern Parahumans know as All-or-Nothing. Interestingly, it is possible to affect other Perfect powers within your radius, allowing you to increase their scope or even turn them “OFF,” so to speak.  
\[Manipulation\] is the direct management of potential variations of energy within your area of effect. This is not energy control so much as potential energy manifestation. It transforms the unused potential energy, or zero-point energy, into other possible variations of said energy such as electricity, seemingly making energy from nothing. It also allows you to effortlessly transform one type of energy into another such as kinetic energy into thermal energy. It is also possible to return energy to its zero-point state. An example would be letting a nuclear bomb go off only for the explosion to just disappear without leaving even a trace of radiation. When used like this, the added zero-point energy can be stored by your Shard to use on a later occasion. This potential energy absorption is the core mechanic by which Entities “feed” at the end of a \[Cycle\].  
When using both \[Simulation\] and \[Manipulation\] together, it is possible to use \[Simulation\] as a framework through which to control energy changed by \[Manipulation\]. This allows you to focus the energy into specific directions and even release it outside of your range of control. This is a highly complex process, but you are given a minor thinker power to help manage it all.  
Should you possess genuine Negentropy, this power doesn’t change much. Rather, it becomes dedicated to managing your personal Negentropy, allowing you to finely control its framework and even increase its efficiency when affecting your other powers, enhancing all benefits they may provide.

*Many-Worlds Interpretation*  
Required:(Breaker/Trump) Ignis Fatuus  
Ignis Fatuus ability to “flicker” through realities has revitalized the discarded \[Data\] of reaching out into the multiverse and successfully reformatted it into a more usable form, giving you the new power expression \[Emulation\].  
\[Emulation\] is the management of potential variations of forms of matter. This allows you to change your environment to a different possible environment. You could be standing in a city only to “flicker” it into the desert; it could have been in a different reality. It is also possible to only target specific objects such as turning a rusty knife into a laser blade.  
The direct manipulation of matter is possible when used in conjunction with both \[Simulation\] and \[Emulation\]. This allows you to optimize changes made to the environment to your favour, such as providing cover from attacks outside your range.  
*Wave Function Collapse*  
Required:(Breaker/Trump) Ignis Fatuus  
Required:The Gibborim Knight  
The power of \[Emulation\] has expanded in scope, allowing you to combine multiple different versions of reality into one. This layering also benefits Ignis Fatuus as it allows you to combine different versions of yourself into a single version of you. This will be version of you will possess all the powers of the different versions of yourself and can even possess fusions of the powers depending on compatibility. However, fusing too many versions of yourself will be taxing on your shard.  
An additional function has also been unlocked, \[Annihilation\]. This is process is done by combining \[Simulation\], \[Manipulation\], and \[Emulation\] all at once to cause combining realities to mutually destroy each other and turn into zero-point energy for your Shard. As you might have guessed, this is the specific mechanic by which Entities “feed” at the end of each \[Cycle\]. Performing this function, while efficient at small scales, becomes very energy dependent at larger ones. This only applies to the start-up process, which is why entities can apply it on a universal scale and still receive a generous amount of energy, but a single shard will simply die trying. A better example would be jumpstarting a full tank portable generator with a car battery versus trying to jumpstart it with a single AA battery.  
That doesn’t mean you don’t have uses for it, however. Your thinker ability has combined with your ability to see representations of other’s powers to allow you to use this function in a defensive manner. Using the images provided as a basis, you can determine what possible action that your opponent is doing, target a reality where this action was successful, and purposefully destroy it, causing that specific action to fail. This is effectively a hard counter to powers such as Path to Victory due to you physically destroying the path they are using. It is possible for them to bait you into destroying a path that they aren’t going to use, but this requires them to manually decide to abandon said path since until it is destroyed, their shard will still determine it to be the best path.  
*Electroweak Theory*  
Required:(Blaster/Mover) Legend  
Required:Electro-Magneto  
Your mastery of the electromagnetic spectrum has been enhanced to the point where you have obtained mastery over the other side of the coin, the weak interaction. Thanks to \[Simulation\] and \[Emulation\], you can control all forms of radiation and radioactive decay. You can not only shoot beams of radiation but can also transform radiation into either more safe or harmful forms depending on your needs. You can also accelerate all nuclear decay within The Ultimate Question’s radius, allowing you to disintegrate anything you want within three-blocks. Your breaker form is enhanced to allow you to turn most attacks against you into zero-point energy to be stored in your shard. All your energy blast may be made All-or-Nothing even if they escape The Ultimate Question’s radius.  
*Quantum Chromodynamics*  
Required:(Breaker/Changer) Ash Beast  
Required:Tsar Bomber  
Your power has enhanced your explosive powerset into a complete mastery of the strong interaction. As Ash Beast already brute-forces Mass-Energy Equivalence through their explosions, the powers’ interaction with \[Manipulation\] with one another leads to the refinement and sophistication to effortlessly transform matter as you would energy, and vice versa, to a greater degree on its lonesome e.g. outright destructive matter reconfiguration. Tsar Bomber's ability to create explosions from a distance is also integrated into this combination with \[Manipulation\] to allow your explosions to take place anywhere within your three-block radius. Your Thinker aspect has also evolved to deal with Ash Beast's power, allowing you to adjust Nuclear Fusion alongside Ash Beast’s conscious control, expanding its scope. Through \[Simulation\] you can enter your Breaker state with a greater level of acumen, selectively destroy things instead of anything within range. You may also use your explosive devices to create transmutative explosions, such as turning everything in a radius to salt, even outside your three-block range.  
*General Relativity*  
Required:(Shaker/Blaster) Fractal of Entropic Decay  
Required:(Shaker/Breaker) Sleeper  
Your control over time has become enhanced, transforming into the manipulation of the curvature of spacetime itself, better known as the fundamental force of gravity. Your storm can now become almost infinitely bigger on the inside, with your control of gravity also allowing you to make “layers” of reality to stack upon each other and create wormholes to connecting any part of the inside of your storm together. This also means that you can create localized time paradoxes by causing future events to connect to the past, with you storm giving you immunity to these paradoxes. Your storm also becomes intertwined with your Shard’s knowledge on Negentropy, allowing you to use any of your functions within the storm even if it grows past your three-block radius.

[(Thinker) Neural Network](#bookmark=id.fg3ry8yu5f54)

(Breaker/Trump) Self-Rewrite  
Cost: 40 SP  
You have the power to rewrite your own existence.  
You are able to change into another person, have any tier 2 power, and turn yourself into anything. You could will yourself into becoming metal, fire, water, space, time, and anything else you could think of.  
You are capable of turning yourself more intelligent, stronger, and faster, all by your will alone. You are also able to teleport across the Wormverse Earth simply by wanting to be there. You can retain your consciousness no matter what you transform into.  
(You can only turn into more esoteric things by buying the Esoteric Knowledge perk or being Shardless. You're also only able to go to other multiverses by having Homecoming).

(Tinker/Trump) Shards  
Cost: 40 SP  
You are a Tinker specialized in manipulating Shards, which allows for personal Shard editing/refining/researching and \[Data\] gain from nearby Shards.  
\[Data\] gathering takes active combat with a Shardbearer to process and copy \[Data\], allowing your Shard to gain these powers or offshoots. You can cannibalize different \[Data\] to strengthen or weaken different powers, adjusting them with your Raw \[Data\] and \[Resources\].  
You gain both passive Raw \[Data\] Acclimation, which accelerates depending on how much \[Data\] you have in your Shard (you can code and edit sweeping changes, on a much larger scale, with a more effective ability creation and incorporation, with a speedier pace depending on your \[Data\]’s quantity and variety you’ve copied from other Shards) and a passive \[Energy\] gain from, both from researching energy-efficient (energy-rich) methods and passively editing your Shard to implement this improvements, which will increase your Shard's lifespan if left unused.  
At the same time, your Shard can be overtaxed if intensively utilized until it breaks in terms of raw \[Energy\] usage, though you will be warned. Having Negentropy will mitigate this risk, based on adding better methods of \[Energy\] usage, production, and allocation.  
If offered direct access to inert Shards e.g. The Garden of Eden, you’ll freely manipulate these Shards with a touch, interfacing with them, plus a significant \[Energy\] expenditure, discover the methods of Shard Construction, and make powers from them, this analysis taking 72 hours of direct contact (with Negentropy or Shardless making this moot, bypassing this condition).  
Shard Construction (by extension Power Creation’s) requirements will take up an incredible amount of Raw \[Data\] and \[Energy\] to assemble, configure, set up, and finally fine-tune up to your task, enough you take the serious risk of immediate Shard Death due to how \[Data\] and \[Energy\]-intensive it is (Negentropy neutralizes this risk, though). The Raw \[Data\] necessary for Shard Construction is about a year's worth of \[Data\] generation (equal to 20 fully \[Data\] replicated Shards worth for a full year as well left unused), with the Raw \[Data\] needed for Power Configuration being variable based on the Shard’s resulting specialization in question.  
Multi-Shard Interface  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Tinker/Trump) Shards  
Your ability to tinker with your own Shard(s) has been expanded to tinker with the Shards of others you are physically touching as well. As a result you can theoretically radically change how a given Shard works and thus the power it generates.  
However, this is not without a cost, as Shards are unlikely to change without cause meaning you have to negotiate with a Shard each time you change it. As a result, expanding a Shard ability costs \[Data\] which will allow you to change the configuration of a Shard without increasing its SP cost. The larger changes you make, especially those not along the lines of a Shard’s core purpose, the larger expenditure of \[Data\] you have to make.  
Furthermore, a Shard is more than just the code it runs, meaning that as you increase the power of the Shard you will also need to improve the hardware the Shard runs on. Thus increasing a Shard’s strength (and thus its power's SP cost) will cost \[Energy\], and significantly more \[Energy\] as the strength of the Shard increases. Moreover, since \[Energy\] is only passively generated over time the increase in required \[Energy\] translates to an increase in required wait time between improvements. This can be shortened by dedicating \[Data\] and \[Energy\] to researching more energy-efficient power generation methods, but even this is a product of diminishing returns. Negentropy significantly reduces the wait time between changes and removes the risk of burning out your Shard from too much energy usage.  
To make matters worse, you also need to consider a Shard’s rank. As you increase the rank of a Shard you also need to increase its size, which is done by feeding it \[Construction\] which can only be generated by the Shard Construction method. Thus increasing the rank of a Shard is equivalent to constructing many inert Shards and feeding them to the already active Shard and thus takes just as many \[Resources\] in both \[Data\] and \[Energy\].

(Breaker) And the Void Stares Back  
Cost: 35 SP  
Your whole body is a door to a pocket dimension. Your surface is a semipermeable membrane, you can choose what can pass and what can't. You can shift your shape, and using materials similar to skin, you can make yourself appear human. You can sound like whatever you want. If you let everything in, you become a very powerful vacuum. If you want, you can just walk through anything. You are completely invincible from all physical attacks, including Sting.

[(Thinker) Vision](#bookmark=id.w4r3pe6ks1gv)

[(Tinker) Revolution](#bookmark=id.wkugu9ptyco5)

(Brute) Avalon  
Cost: 30 SP  
You regenerate near instantaneously, are far more durable than you otherwise would, have unlimited stamina and do not age past your prime, have no limits when it comes to how strong you can become through training, are beloved by nature and its inhabitants, and your willpower is increased.

(Shaker) It Gets Worse  
Cost: 40 SP  
There are few things that can harm you. Not because you're an ultra Brute or so fast you can't get hit. No, you have impossible luck. No one harms you because they get hurt or humiliated or even killed because they tried. The harder, more seriously, and more violently they tried to hurt you, the worse the response from your power. You can still get hurt by accident or if a sufficiently durable and determined person tries hard enough. They might even live long enough to regret it.

(Trump) Manager  
Cost: 30 SP  
You can take/copy the powers of any Parahuman you touch, as well as give the powers you have taken/copied to others. You have fifteen slots to store powers and can have five of them active at a time. You can temporarily go over this limit, but you will suffer thinker headaches that worsen rapidly the longer you are over your maximum limit.  
Negentropy increases your active limit by 2 and your total slots by 5\.  
You can alter the powers in your possession by cycling through different expressions of the same power, modifying them by boosting one aspect at the expense of another, or changing their restrictions. Multiple compatible powers can occupy the same slot and synergize together. Power compatibility depends on the power itself, not its expression.  
This power works on Cauldron Vials and the Garden of Eden; you will get a random expression when getting those powers.  
You can discard unwanted powers, but you will not be able to acquire them again unless you steal/copy them again. Copying powers can take a minute, but stealing them happens instantly.  
*Self Guided Coding*  
Required:Power Guru  
Power Guru can be used on powers stored inside (Trump) Manager, allowing you to grow your copied/stolen abilities over time, as well as on (Trump) Manager itself. Moreover, it treats each power individually with their own cooldowns.  
Power Guru can also be used once a month to generate a single power up to 15 SP held inside Manager.  
*Supervisor Override*  
Required:(Thinker) Vision  
Manager’s ability to copy abilities is expanded upon, allowing you to utilize the information and data from (Thinker) Vision as a vector for replication.  
This allows you to replicate the abilities of anyone and anything capable of being seen in your vision. This also includes anything it could envision as an ability in of itself. If it can be seen in a Vision, it can be replicated.  
This is done by feeding the information from your (Thinker) Vision to your (Trump) Manager and allowing it to construct its own copies as it normally would when encountering powers.  
*Garden Seed*  
Required:(Trump) Power Seed  
You may now plant a power seed into a slot for (Trump) Manager, allowing it to grow there in place of a normal target.  
Planting a power seed inside (Trump) Manager removes your ability to recall it, instead it’ll simply be treated as an ability that was acquired by (Trump) Manager.

(Trump) Oberon  
Cost: 35 SP  
You can gain a permanent copy of the power of any Parahuman you touch. This works on the substance in Cauldron Vials and the Garden of Eden too, though adapted for human use. You can only have five of these powers active at a time, but rather than the Fairy Queen's ghosts, you have these powers for yourself. Negentropy increases your active limit by 2\.  
*Elfame*  
Required:(Trump) [Faerie Queen](#bookmark=id.hhlllmkb87v9)  
Oberon and Fairy Queen merge, gaining each other's functions, you can now use any of the powers of any of your shades for yourself and you can now summon shades for any power you possess, replicated, stole, or otherwise acquired. This includes any of your own.  
Shades no longer need to look like their sources, and you can freely shape them as you wish, no longer beholden to looking like caricatures or even human-like and may reshape them into something new whenever you wish. You can summon the same ability and/or shade as many times as you want as long as you have enough slots.  
Your slots are combined, capable of allocating it to summon a shade or any ability for yourself and you can swap it at any time.

(Trump) Prototype  
Cost: 40 SP  
You have 18 slots to store powers. You can only have 6 active at once but can instantly switch which ones are active. You can instantly empty a slot but it takes 30 seconds to load a power pattern from memory.  
Each day, you gain 10 charges (up to a maximum of 200 stored). You can use these charges to copy, create, and improve powers. You can use 1 charge to copy the power of a parahuman in your line of sight within 100m of you. You can use from 1 to 5 charges to create a new power, the created power will be random unless you constrain it. (1 charge would be around 3 on the PRT scale, 5 charges would be around 7). The more precisely you constrain a power the weaker it will be. You can expend more charges to tweak a created power further to your liking. The only power you cannot reproduce is Eidolon as your power already fulfills that function (that is to select and interface with powers).  
You have two secondary Thinker powers. One that allows you to perfectly recall power patterns, and one that allows you to understand the patterns, modify and combine them into new powers.  
Negentropy increases your daily charges to 15 and your slots to 24\.

[(Changer/Striker) Echidna](#bookmark=id.5nbu1pqxsl0t)

(Breaker/Changer) Ash Beast  
Cost: 35 SP  
You’ve gained an unexplored yet incredibly potent form of matter-energy/energy-matter conversion, best explained by Einstein’s Theory of Special Relativity, where it is posited that energy and mass (matter) are interchangeable, being different forms of the same thing.  
As normally uncontrollable as this power would be, both in usage and premise of “the more Shard gives in power, the more it takes in mind” to the point where you experience a case of ego death not unlike Khepri or Night Hag, you miraculously maintain both your sanity and control at the cost of the full capacity of this power being locked behind conscious input.

You have a Breaker form generated and comprised from your constant transmutation of energy and matter, being energetic in nature it gains side benefits such as superhuman conditioning; survival without oxygen, diseases, and contaminants; and flawless and constant regeneration; all of this is possible through your Breaker form constantly replacing and rearranging itself amidst your explosions and replenishing itself from ambient or surrounding energies, absorbing it like fire, to maintain and augment this form.  
In your Breaker form, you incessantly produce near-uncontrollable explosions around your surroundings from the constant conversion of matter-energy, with the advantage of changing your shape or form from tearing and putting yourself back together from steady explosions.  
Mover powers based on portals and teleportation face difficulties in working their powers on when transformed in your Breaker form, as it chaotically disrupts any grip it has on you.  
To reiterate, thanks to being in your control, it has halved its potency, recovering its past benchmark to a sheer outpouring of energy, exhausting your reserves, or simply letting your power loose.  
Being a question in regards to the lengths this power is capable of, there are some undiscovered applications that anybody hasn’t thought of or gone unsaid.  
*Unravel*  
Required:(Brute) Typhon  
Required:(Breaker/Trump) Cronus  
Your Breaker form has gained the composition of an Endbringer, while also obtaining a step further: a Titan Form where Ash Beast’s cycle-imposed restrictions are lifted to be on a level of a rebel/rampant Shard pulling all stops on his specialization. With Typhon, your compounds both as an energy-dense, extremely durable, and layered vitreous material, losing any sense of pain or loss of efficacy from damage, while retaining Typhon’s physical enhancement and percentual power amplification. With Cronus, it pushes this to its logical extreme, now using your energy-matter conversion as a damage deterrent.  
You can seamlessly shift between your Breaker form and Titan form, with the difference being the enormity of it, a rampant fluctuating physical form with the latter.  
Your Breaker form, with this, develops in flexibility and potency: energy absorption and explosive emission can branch out from more than one type of energy or matter, from chromodynamic to geothermal control or explosions; energy shapeshifting grows to be more liberal on the shapes and composition you emulate, from a volcanic giant hand to a nuclear stomp. This widens with Cronus: Allowing the creation of constructs, energetic-material manipulation, and full control of your combustive energies.  
*Salamander*  
Required:Dragon of Kyushu  
Ash Beast and the Dragon of Kyushu fuse into one, acquiring a Draconic Form alongside your normal Breaker form, with all the characteristics of Dragon of Kyushu integrating its Escalation mechanics and payoff and Ash Beast’s malleable form.  
*Debasement*  
Required:(Shaker/Blaster) Fractal of Entropic Decay  
Your Energy-Matter and Entropy powers have bleed over each other, Ash Beast’s energy-matter conversion accelerates the rate at which your “system” reaches equilibrium, both Diffusing and Exhausting any surrounding matter or energy all over your surroundings as opposed to simply exposing mass and energy into a constant equivalence. To fully explain this, it invites the absorption or diffusion of leftover energy lost amidst Ash Beast’s conversion at the same time leading to an equilibrated “system” to its logical extreme: no energy or matter to speak of, leaving all inert or dead.  
You can toggle this on and off, though, you don’t want to welcome the Heat Death, do you?  
*Ruining Wright*  
Required:(Shaker/Breaker) Sleeper  
The Sleeper has Awoken to a World of Ash, with Ash Beast spreading their constant energy-matter conversion throughout your Storm, remolding into a Firestorm: widespread control of volatile and destructive energies ranging from explosions/implosions, plasma (and its shapes), to kinetic energy to demolish anything on the Firestorm’s path of devastation. Far from the wanton destruction this apparently is, it has a method to its madness; all that you obliterate you lay claim to, having dominion over anything you destroy, remaking it either as exactly as it were, a replica, or whatever you desire. Meaning, that anything you devastate can be recreated to be fully in your control, whether it is adjusting reality or just molding the physical world, varies.  
*Mithra*  
Required:(Breaker/Trump) Golden Form  
Your Golden Form changes Ash Beast’s Breaker Form: Your form stabilises and reaches a composition made of a substance with the properties of both matter and energy, effortlessly shifting your form to a myriad of possibilities; your Energy-Matter Conversion evolving into full manipulation of Mass-Energy and Energy-Matter, the material your Breaker Form is made of, converting any energetic or material stuff into more of yourself while using this as a medium to indirectly control both matter and energy, transmuting it into the ambivalent substance, then turning it back to its original composition.

[(Blaster/Striker) Sting](#bookmark=id.b0frs84btr9h)

(Shaker/Breaker) Sleeper  
Cost: 35 SP  
You’ve gained the ability to create, manipulate, and turn into an incredibly powerful storm, a cloud that shimmers in rainbow colours and cracks, pops, and boils.  
Your storm allows you to subvert everything inside it, gaining the ability to control and manipulate it freely. This allows you to reshape and manipulate anyone and anything inside of your storm, including yourself. This also grants you awareness of everything inside your storm.  
From the manipulation of matter and energy to simple master effects on others, all falls under your domain. The effects do not fade when the storm disappears, the effects remaining permanent until undone.

Incredibly powerful All-or-Nothing of absolute attacks and defenses can resist subversion for a while, however if they stay in the storm for too long even they will fail.  
The speed at which things are subverted to your own use is instantaneous, barring All-or-Nothing effects, for which they’ll have to spend a few minutes inside before they too fall under your control.

You’re also capable of shifting your body into a breaker state made up of your storm, which will allow you to reform yourself anywhere inside the storm, reshape, harden it, or manipulate its properties as you wish. You can even manifest and reshape your storm as a coat of armor and weapons. When shifted into your breaker form you also become capable of directly manifesting your power’s effects outside the storm itself, such as launching powerful blasts of lightning.

When shifted into your breaker form you also become capable of healing any damage to yourself, capable of reforming near instantly, and while in the breaker form itself any damage to the storm is not reflected to your own body, instead forcing it back into human form no worse for wear if your storm is completely annihilated.

When shifted into your breaker form the speed at which your storm swells also grows, and you become able to move your storm. The storm can remain active constantly even without your direct input, covering the same area forever, even while you sleep if desired.  
You can manifest your storm anywhere within a large initial 10km radius around yourself, however it can swell up in size incredibly quickly, capable of growing to envelop multiple settlements or even large portions of a megacity within minutes. The storm’s size will grow at the same rate, capable of growing faster the more it grows.  
If you possess an ability that allows you control over the weather, storms, and/or clouds, your range’s initial radius is increased to whatever size the largest range is among those powers. You are able to use the storm’s ability to its fullest potential even without knowing exactly how it works.  
*Daydreaming Demise*  
Required:Malum  
Required:(Shaker) Bedlam  
Sleeper’s Storm can now sow destruction by replicating any disaster, changing its manifestation accordingly, with your Breaker Form taking after any disaster or catastrophe your Storm is emulating. Your Storm has now the specialty of randomizing reality and generally destabilizing local reality almost to its foundations, creating the Greatest Disaster.

(Shaker/Blaster) Stilling  
Cost: 40 SP  
You now have the ability to wield the power known as Stilling, an incredible power that allows you to negate and manipulate wavelengths.  
Its versatility is immense, as it can be used for disintegrating molecular bonds, canceling heat and sound, slowing or stopping motion, and negating the effects of virtually any superhuman ability/power. It can even be used to heal and far more.  
This power manifests as golden light, which you can shape into any form you wish. All of your "Stilling" effects are completely silent, can range greatly in power (from pencil-thin cutting beams to planet-destroying blasts), and have practically infinite range. Your light can even track and home in on targets, even curving in mid-air.  
You are capable of manifesting a golden aura that grants you the ability to fly at immense speeds. Thanks to the aura itself, you can fly even through space and other hostile environments without any problems.  
You can use your Stilling ability to "tune" your defenses to negate any power, even if they are far more powerful than you. You also have an automatic adaptive defense that makes you immune to anything used against you.  
You are able to use the Stilling ability to its fullest potential even without knowing exactly how it works.  
(Thinker) Path to Victory  
Cost: 40 SP  
You can see the steps needed to accomplish any goal you wish, provided it’s feasibly possible, and can execute each step perfectly. You can choose to let your power take over to follow each step in your place.  
You can have as many paths as you wish, capable of removing, altering, or adding to them at will. You can view the entirety of the path without actually following it, allowing you to use it as a method of gaining information.  
Your power will understand the spirit of your goals instead of merely the letter, accounting for things you may have forgotten to think of.  
This power operates by peering into the infinite possible paths through time and finding one where your goal is accomplished, as such it is true precognition.

### Tier 2

(Tinker/Thinker) Control  
Cost: 20 SP  
You are a Tinker best explained as capable of building or designing anything you can think of, as long as it is related to the idea of Control. You can put together any kind of tinkertech no matter the field or application, the sole restriction being its focus on Administration. For example, capable of concocting any substance imaginable being contingent on easing other’s suggestibility or mental defenses; creating relay rods to transmit information that is suspiciously rewriting people’s minds, being receptive to your short-term or long-term plans; a virus facilitating the control of undesired information or news; establishment of systems controlling and improving the economy, logistics, with all types of infrastructure, and automating sociopolitical processes and mechanisms that facilitate for social conformity; creation of surveillance drones, mechanical methods of building animal or human domesticity, like a helmet able to subvert control from any animal across 3 city blocks; hell, a raygun that bounds a person to your mindset isn’t that far-fetched, etcetera\! With people, the environment, society, yourself, and anything that can be controlled to your advantage is responsive to your tinkertech.  
This specialty also covers the management and administrative side of control, capable of handling the multitasking necessary for any of your ‘drones’.  
With how comprehensively intricate this specialty down to how abstract it is, you also obtain a Thinker aspect providing insights over the idea of control, toeing the line in the middle of intuitive or academically formal; finding it easier to understand power or control dynamics on an organization or group, and having talent on managing large groups of people, knowing the most effective way of controlling your subjects.  
*Proxy*  
Required:(Tinker) Remote Control  
Your drones are now multifaceted tools and proxies you elaborate where your influence will not be denied, meant for project/tinkertech management and proxies for your control: Your drone adapts and responds to any endangerment or opposition that threatens your influence, with improvements on their supporting technology both assist and work towards maintaining as it is enforcing your hold on your sphere of influence; acting as outreach, they take the role of agents to widen your control, so long as you configure your drone accordingly.  
*PsyOp*  
Required:(Tinker) Memory Fabrication  
Required:(Tinker) Emotions  
Required:(Tinker) Illusion  
Your tinker specialties that gravitate around the manipulation of the mind and senses created the perfect toolset for psychological operations and warfare, creating technology and overarching projects geared to subtly influence and change the motives, reasoning, and behaviors of your subjects and within your sphere of control as well.  
Your emotional tinkertech supervises your subjects' willingness to follow orders, and ensures to keep it that way; Your elusive tinkertech keeps your subjects within a "cave" or "mirage" to the world, seeing what you wish them to see; and your remembrance tinkertech creates a controlled environment through a selective pruning or implantation of tailor-made memories that colors their perspective around their control, being more receptive to your whims.

(Brute/Striker) Barebones  
Cost: 15 SP  
Your body is your ultimate weapon, and nothing would be as reliable as your own flesh and bones.  
Every strike you deliver with your body with no aid of any external weapons—whether it’s a punch, kick, or a headbutt, etc—will always inflict disproportionate damage far beyond natural expectations, with a multiplier ranging from minimum x2 to max x1000. This number will apply at random, but the more successfully you land these strikes, the higher the chances that a double or triple-digit multiplier will apply. You have a secondary ability that would negate the effects of Newton's Third law on your body after a multiplier applies. This doesn't enhance your durability, just ensures that you yourself wouldn't incur any physical damage no matter how high the multiplier applied would be,  
You can turn this on/off at will but do note that if you let the power on even outside a combat situation, the multipliers would still apply. From innocently trying to pet a cat and accidentally turning it into a meat paste to shaking someone's hand and crushing it, you have no control over how the multiplier would apply.  
Furthermore, you possess perfect balance and coordination, along with an uncanny, prodigious talent for mastering and acclimating hand-to-hand combat and martial arts techniques.

(Shaker/Stranger) Retroactive Change  
Cost: 25 SP  
You can retroactively alter events up to 3 months into the past, with the extent of the change directly affecting the level of “pushback” you will experience. Pushback causes details of your change to become blurry and beyond your control, introducing random elements that fit with the alterations you made. The more significant the alteration, the more unpredictable these details will become. The more changes made to the environment and people related to the change, the greater the pushback you will experience. Additionally, pushback increases with the number of people aware of the original timeline, as their collective knowledge creates resistance to the change. If there are more than a thousand people aware of the original timeline, then alteration is practically impossible.

When you alter the past, the new version of events replaces the knowledge related to the original timeline for most individuals. However, certain Thinker powers can resist this alteration, allowing their users to retain information from the original timeline. Some powers may even grant the ability to perceive what the timeline was before the change, providing insight into both versions of events.  
The changes must meet these requirements: they must make sense and be possible within the context of the timeline. Additionally, you cannot add new information into people’s minds; you can only replace existing memories. This limitation prevents you from affecting the past of individuals unrelated to the event you are changing.

For example, you can prevent a catastrophic industrial accident from two months ago by ensuring a faulty safety valve is replaced a week before the event. However, pushback causes a minor attack on the facility. People directly involved retain their memories of the changes and those who would have died in the event are now alive, with the person who triggered never triggering here.

[(Master/Mover) Hell on Earth](#bookmark=id.mec2k1a6sm39)

(Shaker/Master) I Heard A Rumour  
Cost: 18 SP  
You have the ability to warp reality, creating creatures, objects and locations born from the collective imagination and beliefs of people, which are known as ‘Rumours’.  
For example, if people start to believe that there are 10 sets of swings in a park, you can manifest it into reality. Similarly, if people believe a serial killer is on the loose, hunting them in particular, you can bring this figure to life.

The strength, duration, and intelligence of these ‘Rumours’ are directly proportional to the number of people who believe in their existence. The more widespread and fervent the belief, the stronger and more autonomous the ‘Rumour’ becomes. Conversely, if people start to uncover the truth—that these phenomena are merely products of your power—the ‘Rumour’ weakens and may eventually dissipate.  
Intelligent ‘Rumours,’ such as beings with thoughts and personalities, remain loyal to you. However, their loyalty is not absolute; they possess a degree of free will and can make independent choices. Non-intelligent ‘Rumours,’ such as objects or simple creatures, are completely obedient to your will without question or deviation.

[(Master/Thinker) Personal Army](#bookmark=id.bt6l912joia6)

[(Shaker/Master) Beasts of Gaia](#bookmark=id.s7smu5ukw5mp)

(Trump/Thinker) Feast  
Cost: 20 SP  
In your eyes, all Parahumans and power effects (including yourself) around you have an energy pool inside them; the stronger the powers, the more energy they contain. The longer you look at this energy, the more you know about the power, initially gaining one to two word generalisations like "Awareness" or "Heat Generation". As you look more, you start to know things like "Always On" or "Needs Touch". Look long enough, and you will know everything about a power, including its weaknesses and applications. Seeing the power in action increases the speed at which you acquire knowledge about it.  
With a touch, you can drain that energy; it takes longer to totally drain the more energy there is; draining a power effect will weaken it until it ceases to exist and draining a parahuman will undermine their power to the point it’s obsolete and they aren’t capable of using it. You can drain energy at range and affect multiple targets, but it's slower than using touch, becoming even slower with distance and the more targets you are draining simultaneously. With time, a parahuman will regain their power; the longer it takes, the stronger the power is. You can also do the opposite, being able to transfer the energy you collected. The same rules for touch and range from draining apply to transference, which allows you to use your capacity to boost and create new aspects of powers that aren't yours.  
You can expend energy to temporarily boost part of a power. Like increasing range, decreasing the time necessary to do something, or giving a new aspect to it. ¼ of that boost becomes permanent; a power that temporarily gained 6 meters to its range now has permanently an additional 1.50 (or one and a half) meters to its range. If you temporarily gave (Trump) Eidolon an extra slot, you would permanently have it but only be able to slot powers that are ¼ the strength.  
Creating new aspects will cost more energy than boosting an existing one and will cost more the more it deviates from the theme and mechanics of the power, new aspects take more energy to boost compared to the base power. Giving your Water Manipulation the capacity to see the future by looking at water would take much less energy than giving your Earth Manipulation precognition while giving your Water Manipulation the capacity to control Ice would take even less energy.

Any powers you enhance will start releasing electricity-like energy or a glow when they are used. This energy/glow happens either on the power themselves or on the part of your body where they originate from. Sometimes both happen to either.  
This power is best used in bursts to conserve the stockpiled energy and because continuous use won't keep increasing the permanent boost. Powers affected by Feast cannot affect Feast.

(Shaker) Snapshots  
Cost: 20 SP  
You can create ‘saves’ of the area and people around you. The longer you stand still while taking the save, the wider the range becomes. Once you take a save it’s stored within your power. You can have up to 7 saves at once.  
You can summon these saves at any time, allowing you to swap your current surroundings with any previously captured moment in an instance in a manner similar to that of Labyrinth. The saves will act normally, and will not know that they are not the real deal, although they can deduce it with time. This means that if one of the saves sees you as an enemy, then they will attack you like normal.  
The duration of your summoned saves depends on its size and your experience. The bigger the summoned saves, the harder it is to maintain. Once the save is dismissed, the area returns back to how it was before you deployed your save.  
Note: Entity Avatars and Endbringers can be saved, but unless you have Queen Shard they will be limited at the power level of what they have shown during their fights. If you have Negentropy and Queen Shard you can create saves of the Entities true body.

(Breaker/Stranger) Vanish  
Cost: 20 SP  
When the user activates their power, they can force any combination of two objects or people to not exist relative to each other. They appear to vanish from each others’ perspective, and any third party observing them will see them look and move straight through each other. Anything that either of them does will not affect the other until the user ends their power’s effects. Anything that a person is holding or wearing is shunted alongside them. This power can also be used by the user.

[(Shaker/Stranger) Call of Oblivion](#bookmark=id.evgpivjzy0bp)

(Breaker/Master) Eldritch  
Cost: 25 SP  
The user possesses the ability to transform into a gruesome creature covered in mouths and hands. When perceived by others, the target will experience a gradual decline in their mental state. The effects of this decline can manifest differently depending on the individual, and can lead to varying degrees of delusions, panic, and paranoia. Once this transformation has occurred, the effects will continue to intensify over time, making the target increasingly susceptible to manipulation and control. Even without prompt, the targets will act in the users favour, their actions assisting the user in reaching their goals.

(Tinker/Trump) Power Tinker  
Cost: 25 SP  
You are a genuine power tinker, meaning you create devices that interact with powers in general including your own. This power has a lot of leeway in how you go about it. Maybe you give a mundane individual the potential for a power via a simulated trigger event. Giving them an appropriate ability based on the shard they connect with and the parameters of the simulated trigger. Or instead, you force a second trigger on an already powered individual. You are also able to make devices that empower and refuel shards, make it easier for their users to control their abilities or use them for longer periods overall, or make temporary or permanent alterations to their powers. Though there is a drawback, the creation of these devices is especially costly and complicated at first. This power is unable to interact with itself.

(Tinker) Cause And Effects  
Cost: 25 SP  
You possess a unique ability to harness the laws of cause and effect, allowing you to create technology that can bend and manipulate reality in incredible ways. Your creations are capable of achieving seemingly impossible feats. such as the creation of a spear that's able to strike a lethal blow through the heart regardless of the circumstances, or the creation of a machine that can simulate the effects of a cause, giving you a prediction of the future. However, you must acknowledge that this power is not without flaws, as some effects are simply impossible to achieve, such as trying to strike a lethal blow through the heart when the target has no heart. Your technology is extremely costly to create, and it is considered a blindspot due to its effects.

(Master) Dragon-Mail  
Cost: 20 SP  
Your allies are mushy, squishy and weak. Your enemies are dangerous and powerful. There are ways around this, but you cannot allow your allies to die so easily. As such, those you designate as allies grow powerful biological scales over themselves, capable of stopping most kinetic impacts (up to even Behemoth punching them) and even esoteric defenses that allow your allies to withstand up to 40% of the damage they would normally take by the enemy.

The scales have a third function. As the biological scales grow over your allies, they undergo a biological change, allowing them regeneration comparable to Lung in his base form, as well as Breaker defenses half that of Immune Response. These biological alterations fade with the scales after the battle ends, but they will allow your allies even further survivability.  
If you do not have allies, you can instead grow them from yourself, biological living entities made of these same scales. They are much weaker, and far more stupid, and will only ever last two minutes, but you can create a dozen before replenishing.

(Tinker/Trump) Embrace the Punk, Become PUNK  
Cost: 15 SP  
Choose a Punk specialization (Atom-Punk, Diesel-Punk, Bio-Punk, Arcane-Punk, Clock-Punk, Nano-Punk, Etc.) and gain beginner-level knowledge of it. At level 0, you acquire basic knowledge of personal gadgets, equipment, and tools to Tinker. As you progress and reach an arbitrary level of production/infrastructure, you have the option to either level up within the same specialization or choose another one. A level-up is qualitative, allowing you to comprehend and produce more complex and far-reaching technologies, such as vehicles, bases, and troupe equipment.  
At level 5, you become proficient in building all non-space-specific Tech of that specialization, giving you the ability to create entire continental structures and make world modifications. This includes societal, mechanical, auto-catalytic, or mental constructions, such as designing governmental structures or ideologies for the masses.  
All level 2 specializations synergize in a positive feedback loop, allowing you to produce increasingly advanced Tech and push the boundaries of what's possible within each specialization, capable of merging multiple punk styles seamlessly so they're not separated.

(Thinker) Clairvoyant  
Cost: 20 SP  
Your senses have been greatly expanded. You can now extend your senses, for example, to see wide areas, multiple things at once, in other universes, whole cities, anyone, and anything. You can even recognize someone calling your name in an entirely different universe. You can scale your ability up and down to your normal senses at any time, and you can choose which senses get amplified and which don't. You can choose to exclude certain areas or subjects from your sight if you wish. You have also been granted the ability to actually make sense of everything you see, capable of easily handling the load of information that comes with seeing everything at once. Looking at everything at once is no more difficult than looking at a single thing at once in normal vision. You can bestow your vision on anyone you touch as well, and you can optionally choose to withhold your ability to withstand the information load to paralyze those you touch.

[(Shaker) Baryonic Creation](#bookmark=id.rllllg6cephj)

(Tinker/Thinker) Hades Protocol  
Cost: 20 SP  
The opposite of \[Gaia's Hand\], you know how to construct tinker structures that methodically reduce a planet's capacity to sustain and grow life. Build massive structures that poison a planetary biosphere, or leverage your intuitive socio-biological understanding to gradually undermine the natural selection of a few planet's species in order to introduce fatal flaws in their biological makeup. This would obstruct progressive acclimatisation to environmental changes, starting a domino effect that would eventually lead to ecological collapse.

(Tinker/Thinker) Gaia's Hand  
Cost: 20 SP  
You gain an extensive understanding of planetary formation, evolution, and taxonomy to build tinker structures that artificially restructure worlds to contain sustainable habitations for sentient/sapient life with sufficient time and resources (as well as per-existing conditions). You also gain a comprehensive understanding of sociobiology (stuff like behavioral simulation, population biology and game theory) as well as models on altruism and evolutionary strategies through intuitive socio-metrics tailored to pinpoint precisely how to expedite the growth of complex and sapient life through evolutionary pressures.

(Tinker) Techno-Organic  
Cost: 20 SP  
From Flesh to Metals. To veins and wires. From brains housing debatable definitions of sapience to powerful AI cores to blood and coolant; there are a long list of different specialties that can focus on either wetware or hardware. Sometimes merging in limited ways but all the same difference between them. Biology is able to grow and evolve but can be slow when it comes to strong change. Technology is the aspect of progression and adaptation; able to be improved on countless times; but it is static if nothing advances it, it will stagnate and rust.  
But you? You, my good friend, are the singularity in both fields. You specialize in techno-organic or Bio-mechatronics, deleting the boundaries between hard and wetware to create something better than the sum of its parts. From a set of power armor that can be fused and stored within one's body granting increased protection to access to advanced weapons and digital systems. Creating modules that absorb other unclaimed tech and adapting to a system. Devices that can regenerate or even T.O.-nanites that can think and make quick adjustments faster than an average nanite could. Produce advanced T.O.-ware that can grant someone advanced nano-netics with nothing but a simple pill or shot maybe even a way to transfer one's consciousness perfectly with no error after enough study. Beasts of all shapes and sizes can be made, all outfitted with technology weaponry integrated in them so deeply their descendants will have their modifications. The sky's the limit and nothing can hold you back.

(Tinker) Supervillain  
Cost: 25 SP  
Unleash your inner Bonds Villain, and turn any object into a reality-warping device, whether it be a gun, car or even toaster, granting it phenomenal power. Convert your weapon into a devastating space-shattering super beam, transform your car into a space-time manipulation device or even turn your toaster into a device that can heat the entire world and launch it off its orbit. However, these devices will come with a high price, requiring vast amounts of resources and manpower. Specific rare elements serve as the cornerstones of the devices, elements that cannot be fabricated in a lab or purchased commercially but are found in locations that may be dangerous and inaccessible. Obtaining these resources can consist of a trip to a challenging location, such as a deep sea trench for heavy water, a core sample from an unstable glacier, geodes from the Earth's mantle or mineral deposits from the dark side of the moon. Other resources may require materials from someone's possession or even regarded as a national treasure, such as the Hope Diamond, to work. The actual diamond itself is needed, not a similar stone or even an atomically perfect replica, as there is always a crucial component that facilitates the enormous power of these superweapons. Your arsenal of super devices grows with your familiarity with technology and your ability to apply those specialties to new weaponry, such as robotic giant robots that grow as they eat metal or mutagenic spores that can mutate the planet.

[(Trump/Thinker) Who Do You Think I Am?](#bookmark=id.h14l01txion4)

[(Stranger/Master) Identity](#bookmark=id.evgpivjzy0bp)

(Trump/Master) Magical Plant  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can grow magical plants that can grow shards of their own, causing them to gain powers. When you first plant them, you can choose a theme that the power will take on, though the exact specifics will be random. They grow at a rate of 1 SP every three days, but the growing rate halves every 15 SP. Every day you can choose to either plant a new plant, or boost the growth of a previous plant, causing it to instantly grow 3 days of growth in any direction you want. The ways these plants may manifest their powers vary, but you have a natural psychic link with your plants, allowing you to control their powers. These manifestations may be things like plants that shoot fireballs, slow time around them, or even grow fruit that when consumed give temporary powers. By taking care of and showing love to your plants, you can slightly encourage how the plants improve their powers, with their surrounding environment playing a heavy factor. New plants may germinate from the seeds of these plants, though they will only start half as strong as the original, and grow half as fast.

[(Thinker) Time-Loop](#bookmark=id.bz98atbiq8wf)

(Striker/Shaker) Tyrant  
Cost: 20 SP  
You possess near-absolute dominion over all forces within a 15 cm radius of your body. In combat, you can unleash punches and strikes that appear ordinary but carry unimaginable force, amplifying the energy behind them to levels beyond comprehension, resulting in devastating impacts akin to meteoric collisions. Or, through your precise control over kinetic energy, effortlessly drain the momentum of bullets fired at you, suspending them in mid-air as harmless projectiles.  
Beyond raw strength, you can even manipulate all electromagnetic fields near you. With a touch, you can render electronic devices useless or generate devastating surges.  
Furthermore, your mind is enhanced, enabling subconscious calculations of the forces you control with precision. This heightened cognitive ability allows you to effortlessly and intuitively manage the vast array of forces at your disposal, ensuring unparalleled and seamless control over the forces within your 15 cm radius.

(Breaker) How The Turns Have Tabled\!  
Cost: 18 SP  
You have gained the power of Inversion, allowing you to manipulate the cause and effect of your actions within a 30-minute timeframe. With this ability, you can achieve astonishing feats by bending time to your advantage.  
In your everyday life, simple tasks like packing your bags, or cooking become instant as you invert cause and effect, making your bag already packed with precisely what you would have included, or a meal already cooked the moment you walked into the kitchen. However, the accuracy of the outcome decreases the further in time you go, due to the increasing variables of possibilities. Within the first 10 minutes, you maintain nearly 99% accuracy in achieving your intentions. At the 20-minute mark, your accuracy remains around 90%, while at the 30-minute limit, it decreases to 80%.  
In combat, your actions become unpredictable and unstoppable. You can fire a gun, and by inverting cause and effect, the bullets appear to have already hit the target before you even pull the trigger. As with everyday tasks, your accuracy diminishes as you approach the 30-minute limit.

(Shaker) Phir Sē  
Cost: 20 SP  
You can make golden doorways back in time for around a few minutes. It takes concentration to open them and maintain them, so you can only open them nearby or through a screen. It gets harder and harder to chain multiple portals so you can't travel through days and days on end. Anyone passing through will replace their past selves but now have their future's injuries and possessions.  
You can make a "time bomb" by looping light between two portals, aided by your power to become increasingly powerful with time.  
(You're unable to go before your entry unless you have Homecoming.)

(Tinker) Research And Development  
Cost: 16 SP  
You are an Omni-Tinker with access to every technology tree, however, your access is initially limited, but as you create Tinkertech, your access to these trees expands. Initially, your inventions closely resemble conventional technology. Yet, by crafting Tinkertech, you unlock greater access to every technology tree involved in its creation. Furthermore, studying Parahumans and other Tinkers' technology grants partial access to their respective trees. With extensive analysis, you can eventually gain full access to any capability possessed by those Tinkers, and even create Tinkertech that replicates or is based on any power you have sufficiently analyzed.  
*Innovation*  
Required:\[TRIUMPHANT\]  
Your power serves a unique purpose beyond merely stress-testing the Entity scientific database from the ground up. It is tailored to detect anything overlooked by the Pair, deemed unreliable to test, or considered a dead end. Specifically, your ability is honed to challenge the scientific database against any new phenomena it encounters, including Out of Context anomalies or forbidden avenues like the spatial camouflage of Core Shards or the Virtual Space called the Firmament/Shard Space.  
As a result, your only limitations lie in phenomenons you can only personally research for various reasons. You possess the capability to investigate phenomena such as Magic, Psionics, QI/CHI, or any Out of Context problems you encounter, even without possessing Esoteric Knowledge (Your research speed will accelerate tremendously if you have it though).  
*Copyright Infringement*  
Required:(Tinker) Techie  
You can create tinker tech that perfectly replicates any power that you’ve had an opportunity to analyze. This doesn’t not have to be a 1:1 recreation, instead this allows you to break down the principles behind the power and freely use it for your own uses, including building tinker tech that perfectly replicates it.

[(Master) Chessman](#bookmark=id.owrixivh2l4j)

[(Master) Undead](#bookmark=id.46l8gpsatez5)

(Shaker) Liminal Landscaper  
Cost: 20 SP  
You have 3 regenerating charges of power a day that can be invested into a \[Liminal Threshold\], which can be defined as the boundary between any two differentiated areas, investing a charge of power into the Liminal Threshold creates a separate layer of reality called the Liminal Landscape, that things cross into if they pass over the invested liminal threshold. This is a directional threshold, and connected thresholds can be used to implement other bits and pieces into the landscape. Each charge increases the size of the Landscape as well as the depth of your control over it. Your control over the liminal space is determined by the amount of charges you have, \+ whatever charges are invested in the landscape. You are able to change multiple properties of the landscape beside the topology, within the landscape you can summon or create tools/interfaces in order to allow you to change and manipulate any of the sensorial features of the Landscape Such as sound, lighting, smell, and various other cosmetic or aesthetic things. You cannot directly control the area around living things, but your speed of change is rapid outside that area.

(Striker/Shaker) Overhaul  
Cost: 20 SP  
You have gained the incredible power to reconstruct the molecular structures of anything you touch with astounding precision. By making contact with an object or individual, you instantly comprehend their molecular arrangements, granting you the power to rearrange and alter them at will.  
With this knowledge, you hold the ability to reconstruct your own body, granting you the power of pseudo-shape-shifting. Through precise manipulation of your molecular structure, you can adapt your physical form to suit various situations or assume different identities.  
Initially, the range of your Overhaul power spans approximately 99 meters from your point of contact. However, as you grow in mastery and experience, both the potency and range of your abilities will expand over time. This gradual growth ensures that you can exert your influence over a broader area and manipulate molecules with increasing finesse.  
In addition to these extraordinary capabilities, Overhaul grants you the option to disassemble, restore, or reshape any target you touch. Whether it is living or nonliving, the choice rests in your hands.

(Trump/Striker) Fictiportation  
Cost: 15 SP  
Imagine being able to pull out any object from your favourite stories, as long as it fits on a screen or a page. You can reach out and grab anything from fiction, whether it's a magic wand, a lightsaber, or a sonic screwdriver. The only catch is that the more powerful the item is, the more energy it drains from you. The more popular and widely known the item is on the other hand, the easier it is for you to access it. So you can't just grab some obscure artefact from a forgotten book and expect it to work. But you can use Harry Potter's invisibility cloak or Doctor Who's psychic paper with no problem.  
You start out being able to summon objects equivalent to a PRT Rating 5 in power if they're somewhat well-known. Over time this power will grow, particularly with practice and usage, allowing you to summon stronger and more obscure objects.   
The maximum power of an object you could theoretically acquire is limited to a PRT Rating 10\.

(Brute/Trump) Anu  
Cost: 25 SP  
Your power is a conceptual fusion of both Lung and Eidolon. That is to say, your power continually ramps up through raging conflict which grants you new temporary powers. Then again, it isn't to say you can surely exploit it with nothing as even outside of combat your baseline grants you a low-level Alexandria package comparable to Glory Girl’s alongside an additional low-level blaster power in similar potency to Lady Photon.  
As your power ramps up, your baseline continuously grows next to your invulnerability branching out from general durability and adaptively developing immunities to the parahuman effects you’re battling against or alongside, your Brute and Blaster powers will similarly gain an adaptive diversity to be more formidable against powers you are contending on the fight’s both sides for any eventuality, while your flight speed continuously increases, your mind simultaneously improving to perceive and function at your constantly dashing speed and growth rate.  
During this escalation, you’ll temporarily develop powers meant to aid you amidst your battles. Depending on the circumstance, these powers can fluctuate from solely meant for combat i.e. a striker power meant to disintegrate what you touch, to utility-based powers i.e. a Thinker power focusing on target location. The powers’ growth rate is naturally equivalent to your baseline powers, though developing new powers will delay your growth rate.  
Finally, you can affect your growth rate. Like Lung, you are capable of charging up in anticipation of a fight to accelerate your ramping up, yet, unlike Lung, you are fully capable of beginning to ramp up outside of battle, although it would be extremely slow on top of only capable of reaching a mid-level Brute and Blaster for your baseline. Additionally, this control over your growth rises in effectiveness in combat, being able to “steer” it in certain directions e.g. from focusing on escalating your invulnerability to directing it to develop a new power to assist you.  
*Escalating God*  
Required: (Trump) Queen of Escalation  
Your power's adaptations are now permanent, while still following the rules of your power and the need to ramp up into total immunity. At their base level, they make you resistant to those powers.  
Additionally, powers that you gain throughout ramping up now become permanent. Yet, your additional powers can be strongest when non-ramped up is equivalent to a high T1 power.

[(Shaker/Mover) Nyx](#bookmark=id.73ncua3afdb)  
(Shaker/Mover) Eos  
Cost: 20 SP  
With this power, you can manipulate light with precision and control. You have the ability to create, shape, and harness light for various purposes. While light is typically used to illuminate everything, it can also be harnessed as a form of extreme heat and a tangible substance. With this power, you have the capability to manipulate entities within light, establish and dissolve shields and areas of blinding light, construct tools and weaponry sharp enough to rend through steel like a hot knife through butter, create radiant servants that are able to go toe to toe with high-level brutes, teleport vast distances by traversing through bright light, and your versatility with this power is only limited by your imagination. Your range extends within a radius of 200 meters around you, and you can also harness unlimited multitasking with this power. It's worth noting that powers based on darkness can pose a significant threat to you, but your ability to withstand and resist these dark-based abilities increases in brighter environments, allowing you to maintain a stronger defense against them.  
[Chiaroscuro](#bookmark=id.73ncua3afdb)

(Tinker) Dyson Sphere Program  
Cost: 25 SP  
You gain the technological knowledge specializing in mega structure and stellar engineering. With expertise in harnessing star energy, constructing colossal structures, and optimizing production on a massive scale, you become a master of this advanced field. Your abilities encompass building Dyson spheres, creating interstellar factories, and designing intricate supply chains. Armed with this knowledge, you reshape celestial bodies, unlock untold potential, and become a visionary architect of a grand technological civilization in the cosmos.

(Master/Tinker) Master of Green  
Cost: 15 SP  
You possess the power to manipulate plants in countless ways, shaping them to meet your every need or desire.  
This power gives you an unlimited capacity to multitask and complete mental awareness over all plants within a 1 km radius of yourself. You can control plants within this radius but it is limited to those you have directly interacted with; for example, planting, watering, tinkering or physical contact. Through this, you can make any plants under your control grow, move and act as you desire.  
You can massively accelerate the growth of any plants under your control, enabling them to develop within days rather than months or years. You are capable of enhancing their strength and durability to be equal to the toughest natural woods and can increase their size significantly beyond what's normally possible. You can freely modify their shape if you have enough plant material to work with and adjust the characteristics of the plants under your control to possess particular properties. This encompasses natural properties that plant species have, such as toxin production, fire-resistant bark etc, but can also include the properties of plants that you subsequently create through the tinker aspect of this power.  
Your tinker focus is broad and versatile, allowing you to tinker with any plant species you come across and beyond. You can vastly improve and expand upon the original properties of plants, such as augmenting their ability to photosynthesis, or also develop completely new properties in your plants such as secreting strong acids, generating bioelectricity or actively camouflaging. You can intermix different species of plants together to form hybrids and create entirely new species to suit your purposes such as predatorial meat-eating trees, flowers with explosive seeds and much, much more. This power noticeably improves and synergises well with any other plant-based power.

(Tinker/Trump) Mind is Matter and It'll Make the Whole World Go Round  
Cost: 20 SP  
You specialize in psychics and psionic technology. The way the mind expands to the nervous system that connects it to an organism's body, is your plaything. From tractor beam like devices that use telekinesis to scanning tech that uses psychometry, to Brain-to-machine interfaces that can easily grant people technopathy-like power. You even know the wet work version of this tech and can induce psionic powers to people or even animals through careful experimentation. Finally you can create psychic stabilisers and augmentation devices to give boost to these powers.

(Tinker) The Factory Must Grow  
Cost: 20 SP  
You gain the technological knowledge specializing in mega factories, mass production, and industrialization. With expertise in building massive industrial complexes, optimizing production lines, and managing vast logistical networks, you become a master of this advanced field. Your abilities encompass constructing colossal factories, automating processes on an unprecedented scale, and streamlining the mass production of goods. Armed with this knowledge, you revolutionize industrialization, reshape economies, and propel civilizations into a new era of productivity and abundance.  
With your combined expertise in mega factory, mass production, and industrialization, you become a visionary leader, driving the rapid expansion and transformation of industrial landscapes. You harness cutting-edge technologies, employ advanced robotics and artificial intelligence, and optimize resource utilization to fuel unprecedented levels of output. The world becomes your canvas as you create towering manufacturing complexes, interconnected networks of production facilities, and vast supply chains spanning entire continents. Your mastery of mega factory technology propels you to the forefront of innovation and economic prosperity, forever shaping the destiny of civilizations.

[(Tinker) Upcoming Century](#bookmark=id.u0op4o6gy5er)

(Master/Trump) Sin Manifestation  
Cost: 20 SP  
You can create a monster based on the sins of the selected person. Their strength correlates to the amount of good and bad sins they committed in their life based on personal ideology. Its power will be capable of countering the chosen target.  
The Monster's intelligence and strength scale directly to the number of sins the target selected. You can target them from anywhere as long as you know their name. If they committed enough sins, the Monster would be able to outsmart their enemy like some kind of 5D chess. If the Monster defeats the target, they stay and help you for other things.

(Tinker) Infection  
Cost: 20 SP  
You're a Tinker specializing in biological plagues and horrors. You can build all sorts of weapons that can wreak havoc on the population. From zombie viruses to fungus that infects anything alive, you can even create creatures that overtake sewers and create earthquakes. Your zombies are even able to use their knowledge, skills, and powers in life to best infect others.  
You can make yourself or others immune to any form of pathogen or infection even if you didn't create them. Your zombies won't target you or your work either even if you're a perfect meal.

(Tinker/Thinker) Solarpunk  
Cost: 18 SP  
You specialize in a conceptual form of tinkering that focuses on the idea of Solarpunk, a movement that focuses on and envisions a potential sustainable future where both nature and technology are one. You have specialties in renewable energy, arcology design, climate tech, alternative materials, drones, medicine, horticulture/agriculture, prosthetics (complete replacement limbs), terraforming, biological enhancements/genetics, and information storage. But that's not the only thing; you are also able to redesign technology to accommodate the solarpunk way. Turn a gas guzzler into an EV that gets power from integrated solar panels on the roof. Or maybe redesign that phone in your pocket to use safer materials, which can last up to several decades. You also get a minor power to convert plant material into usable components for tinkering, as well as enhanced memory concerning green technology and positive social engineering. They become just as similar to any inorganic version but also have the properties of a plant. They could even be replanted to grow more, and they become resistant to supernatural manipulation; other chlorakinetics won't be able to alter them. Reject the doom and praise the Sun\! 

(Tinker) Cyber Dystopia  
Cost: 18 SP  
You specialize in a conceptual form of tinkering that goes against the principles of Solarpunk, envisioning a potential future that diverges from the sustainable ideals of harmonizing nature and technology. Your expertise lies in areas that deviate from renewable energy and environmentally conscious practices. Instead, you focus on fields such as fossil fuel extraction, heavy industry, resource exploitation, advanced weaponry, surveillance technology, genetic manipulation for profit-driven purposes, and disruptive technologies with little regard for ecological balance.  
With your knowledge, you excel in redesigning technologies to maximize efficiency, profit, and power, often at the expense of environmental well-being. You have an enhanced memory for these exploitative practices and possess the ability to manipulate and corrupt plant material for industrial purposes, devoid of their natural properties. These modified components resist supernatural manipulation, making them impervious to chlorakinetics or any other form of natural influence. Embrace a dystopian vision and prioritize the pursuit of power and profit over environmental sustainability.

(Mover/Thinker) Ideal Transit  
Cost: 20 SP  
You can warp yourself and those you touch anywhere you ask. If you want to go somewhere safe, you will teleport somewhere that will be safe. If you want to teleport somewhere that will help you achieve a goal, you will teleport to a location that can assist with that. You don't even need a clear image to teleport.

[(Shaker) The Sound of Silence](#bookmark=id.adwrm87of3v2)

(Shaker/Mover) Dimension Tripper  
Cost: 25 SP  
You can create and visualize alternate dimensions and universes that allow you to send designated targets within your vision to them. This is accurate enough to send handheld tools or even worn armor to different pocket dimensions while being held. You can even send yourself or other people there. While there are a vast amount of options, you can create hostile miniature dimensions that can have a variety of different effects that don't match normal physics. Such as Dimensions where Machines cannot work or Dimensions where it perfectly matches a universe.  
You cannot create sentient life with this ability. And the effects of the created dimensions apply to you as well as anything or anyone there.

(Blaster/Master) Pithing Needle  
Cost: 23 SP  
You can create and control long astral needles with precision at up to 50mph. When a needle is piercing someone you can access and harvest something from their mind. This could be a memory, skill, personality trait, or anything else that is purely mental. You can then inject what you took into yourself or someone else. You can remove and insert partial aspects, such as taking hatred toward something and putting it into someone else tied to something else. You can only interact with aspects of the thinker's powers that would remain even if the Parahuman's power was nullified.  
Your needles can access the corona of pierced parahumans. You can harvest and inject traits of powers, such as methods of control, power-granted senses, and other such things.

(Master/Trump) Logic Virus  
Cost: 20 SP  
Your body emits an undetectable virus within a small range of 5ft around you. You can choose which people are actively infected with a thought. (Everyone touched by the aura is a dormant infected)  
Active infected limit is 200 and shard users take up more than one slot depending on ability, Eidolon for example takes 100 while Alexandria takes 35\.  
Endbringer's cores are the only part that can be infected with this power, the range still applies but it must be in relation to the core. An active infected Endbringer costs 120\. (You'll need some help for this one)  
The infected will begin to act differently from their normal selves, becoming stronger and more powerful ability-wise as well, they will also begin to hate what you tell them to and think about things as you do. These changes are not instant but slow and will take about a week.  
You can change an Active infected back to a passive infected, this will take only 30 seconds and the person will remember everything they did during their time active. They will almost certainly assume you mastered them if you ever gave them direct commands but will assume nothing other than the fact that they were acting strange if all you did was a subtle influence.  
After activation, they will be incredibly loyal to you and never question why, they will hang on to your every word and command even dying for you. When not near you they will act on your mental commands, or in your best interests. (Entities are immune)

(Mover) Door Me  
Cost: 25 SP  
You can make portals to anywhere you've seen since triggering, even if only through pictures or videos. As many as you want, and anything that passes through one keeps all its momentum.

(Thinker) Number Man  
Cost: 15 SP  
You are good with numbers to a Parahuman degree. You perceive this power as elaborate mathematical notation floating in the air. You can dodge attacks, predict future actions, identify weak points, sense the surrounding area through vibrations, perfectly measure things with a glance, leverage your strength perfectly, and much more. You wouldn't have a hard time predicting and manipulating the world economy.

(Thinker/Trump) Kingmaker  
Cost: 25 SP  
Kingmaker grants you the power of the ultimate wise old mentor archetype. With this Thinker ability, you can choose up to five parahumans to take in as students and intuitively understand their strengths, weaknesses, and optimal training methods. Through your guidance, even the most naive and unremarkable individuals with weak powers can be transformed into once-in-a-century geniuses, capable of achieving greatness and potentially challenging deities.  
Your wisdom shapes their intellect and skills, empowering them to become heroes on the path of greatness. As the Kingmaker, you wield the ability to unlock and enhance the powers ~~granted by shards~~, turning even the weakest powers into formidable forces capable of leaving an indelible mark on the world.

(Blaster/Mover) Legend  
Cost: 20 SP  
Your very being is entwined with energy on fundamental levels. You can fire blasts of light whose properties and effects are within your control. Forking or homing lasers, freeze beams, disintegrating spheres that orbit around you in a pattern. All of these and more are within your capabilities. At their strongest, a single one of these can destroy a skyscraper easily. You can fire a dozen blasts at once and coordinating such barrages is trivial for you.  
You are also able to fly, reaching the speed of light in an instant. Your mind will automatically compensate for relativistic time dilation by slowing down or speeding up.  
You are able to switch back and forth between a breaker state that removes all physical needs, and quickly restores you to perfect physical condition. In this state, most attacks are simply absorbed, with only the strongest able to put you down before the damage is gone. Your vision is perfect, encompasses the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and no longer degrades with distance.

(Tinker) Hero  
Cost: 20 SP  
You have Hero's power. You are a highly versatile Tinker that specializes in wavelength manipulation. This power allows the mimicry of the Entities' Stilling power.

(Brute/Mover) Alexandria  
Cost: 20 SP  
You are nearly invulnerable. No effect or force can negatively affect you physically except for Sting or the Siberian. This extends even to the functions of your own body, meaning that you never tire, require no sustenance (air included), and even negative mental effects are limited to the point that you don't have to worry about stress doing permanent mental harm. Even sleep is just for pleasure or relaxation rather than a need to refresh yourself.  
You have incredible amounts of strength and can fly and move at supersonic speeds, with perfect maneuverability and reaction time to match. Your mind is enhanced just like your body, skyrocketing your mental capabilities to superhuman levels, with an absolutely perfect memory.  
The field that pervades your body providing these abilities also extends itself to things you are touching, letting you ignore the effects of physics when you apply your strength and speed. You have more leverage than should be possible when you grab something, exert immense force with minor motions, large objects don't collapse under their own weight, and catching or carrying people at extreme speeds won't harm them. You are an unstoppable force and an immovable object.

[(Thinker/Breaker) For The Want Of A Nail](#bookmark=id.kfgxo5jspjtt)

[(Trump) Faerie Queen](#bookmark=id.x9phyov4rvqd)

(Trump) Eidolon  
Cost: 20 SP  
You have Eidolon's powers without the worthy opponent issue. You can have three somewhat-random powers that you can change at any time you want. These powers can be very powerful. You can switch out quality for quantity and have five weaker powers instead of three stronger ones. All powers take a couple of minutes to build up strength, though they're still usable before reaching full strength. You can still run out of energy with this power. You're a precognitive blindspot to everyone but the entity.  
Negentropy increases your slots to five strong or nine weaker powers.  
Higher Priest  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Trump) Eidolon  
You can now directly influence the powers you get. It isn't as simple as just choosing the powers you want but you can place basic requirements such as 'it must be a laser power', or 'it must grant me a form of flight', or 'it must be a tinker power'. You can also hold onto powers for a longer period of time.

(Breaker/Trump) Ignis Fatuus  
Cost: 20 SP  
You have the ability to “flicker”, allowing you to page through realities and possible states of yourself and those you touch and swap them in either piece by piece or in whole. By finding another version that is not injured you can swap their states and heal them, by finding and swapping the states of a nude person with another that is clothed you can clothe them. You can even swap positions with another possible state allowing teleportation. You cannot use this to grant others powers.  
And finally, you gain one power slot that you can individually swap out at will, such as a powerful aerokinetic power capable of offense or defense. The power can only be as powerful as a single power that a full-powered Eidolon could summon. You're a precognitive blindspot to everyone but the entity.  
If you pick Negentropy you gain two additional power slots, and can choose to have a power be held in more than one slot, each additional slot dramatically increasing its power.

(Shaker) Inviolable  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can create a large number of inviolable forcefields, your only limit is visualization and concentration. You must be able to keep track of all the forcefields you create, a multitasking power greatly increases the number you can manage at once.  
Each individual forcefield can be at most 400 square meters in surface and 10 cm thick, multiple fields can interlock to form a larger one. You can control the permeability at will. Nothing short of Sting can penetrate these. The edges of these forcefields are sharper than anything any Tinker has ever made, unless you intentionally smooth them out.

(Master) Bringer of the End  
Cost: 20 SP  
You gain control of a custom Endbringer.  
Precognition  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your Endbringer can see every possible future, with the entities as the only blind spot.  
Telekinesis  
Cost: 10 SP

Earth  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your Endbringer can control the Earth. They can cause Earthquakes, throw boulders, or just lift the earth below a city and flip it upside down.  
Copy  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your Endbringer can copy the power of any Parahuman you know exists or existed. You can have the powers of 3 Parahumans copied at a time. This cannot copy the powers of people who have had their powers permanently lost.  
Time  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your Endbringer can speed or slow time by up to 10000% anywhere within a mile. They can mix and match this as you like.  
Gravity  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your Endbringer can alter gravity anywhere within ten miles. They can make the gravity of an area equal to that of the surface of the sun, though that might start to destroy the planet, so please don't have them do that.  
Mind-Control  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your Endbringer can control the minds of any Parahuman that has been within 5 miles of them for over 10 minutes. Your Endbringer has to actively activate the timer and there is a signifier to everyone in their range that this is happening.  
Summoning  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your Endbringer can summon corrupted heroes from the Throne of Heroes to fight for them. Some heroes can fight the corruption, but they are few and far between. They can summon no more than ten of these corrupted heroes at a time.  
Vaatu  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your Endbringer has control over all of the elements within three miles of them. These elements are fire, water, air, and earth, not the ones on the periodic table.  
Dynakinesis  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your Endbringer can redirect any energy that comes in contact with them, if they are aware of it coming. This includes kinetic energy.  
Flash

Saitama  
Cost: 5 SP  
Your Endbringer is moderately stronger than the other Endbringers.  
Minion  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your Endbringer has the ability to build and manipulate small minions that resemble itself. The control will be total, and they can make up to a hundred of them. The less minions created, the stronger each will be. A singular one will be as powerful as a strong brute, however, if the number of minions is limited to one, it will become comparable to an Endbringer's strength. The inferior minions are made from flesh, with fewer of them resulting in stronger and more durable creations made of a similar crystalline material that Endbringers are made of. Your Endbringer can transmit their other abilities through their minions, and determine if their minions should act on their own utilizing the intelligence of a dog, or direct them personally.  
Neverending Army  
Cost: 10 SP  
Within 3 miles your Endbringer can resurrect the dead as revenants, bringing them under its control and making them immortal, no matter the state of the corpse it can be brought back with all damage being healed, if the corpse is in multiple pieces multiple revenants can be made from it. No matter the damage a revenant always comes back, the worse the injury, the longer they take to heal and resurrect, a tiny cut takes 1 second to heal, complete annihilation of the body takes 1 minute for the body to be remade.  
Revenants have all the memories from when they were alive but no attachment to them, only using them to follow the commands of your Endbringer to the best of their ability.  
Your Endbringer can use its senses and communicate telepathically to issue commands, being able to talk with all of its revenants simultaneously. Together with this your Endbringer has an instinctive understanding of whether a revenant does or not have a power and what it is.

[(Brute) Unlimited Potential](#bookmark=id.9w3qw5jjc029)

[(Shaker/Blaster) Magnets, Son\! How do they work?](#bookmark=id.jrnkcq3xdfd7)

(Master/Stranger) If Anything Were To Happen…  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can not be harmed, arrested, detained, captured, imprisoned, or otherwise obstructed by any non-powered persons or non-sapient beings. Immediately before making such an attempt, they will decide to spend the next hour zealously trying to kill their compatriots and then themselves.

### Tier 1

#### Stranger

(Stranger/Shaker) Sensorium  
Cost: 15 SP  
You are capable of producing an invisible, intangible “fog” over a large area. This fog is capable of hijacking the senses of everything inside, living or artificial (like cameras and microphones), giving you the ability to access and override them at will to make them experience whatever illusions you desire, effectively turning the area into a holodeck. You are also capable of creating illusions of the same calibre that can be visible even to people outside the fog, although you will not get to access their senses or be capable of specialising the illusions to specific people like you would if they were inside.  
You can range from giving everyone in the fog the same illusion to giving each individual person a different personalised experience, with their expectations and knowledge filling in the gaps for any details about the illusions you don't personally assign (how it breaks, what it looks like on the back, etc.).  
Those inside the fog will instinctively act in such a way to maintain the illusions they’re observing (i.e. if they lean against an illusory wall they will unconsciously lean in such a way that they are still balanced and thus won't fall through it), if they push past these instincts and/or make mistakes the illusions automatically adjust to maintain realism and explain away any inconsistencies caused by the illusion in whatever way the subject thinks would make the most sense (i.e. if they tripped and fell through an illusory wall then the illusory wall will have “broken”).  
Your power is even capable of hijacking and tricking exotic senses like thinker powers, although they take more focus to understand and manipulate.

(Stranger/Master) Absolution  
Cost: 10 SP  
You possess the uncanny power to ensure that no matter what you do, you will always be forgiven for your actions by the individuals affected. Whenever you do something that would cause offence, resentment or hostility in any form, the people impacted will automatically, completely forgive you for whatever you did.  
For example, you could verbally harass or even directly harm someone and they would absolve you. This doesn’t alter or erase an individual’s memories, it only ensures that they will not form a grudge or hold whatever you’ve done against you. This power will cause those affected to subconsciously justify or rationalise your actions, convincing themselves that your behaviour wasn’t that bad or that there was a good reason for it, but only to the point of indifference.  
*You ARE the Messiah\!*  
Required:(Master/Stranger) Divine  
Instead of only justifying or explaining your actions to the point of indifference, individuals affected by your power will now continually rationalise your actions to that of reverence and worship, no matter how ridiculous or horrific the act.  
Spit in someone’s eye? A blessing bestowed from the almighty. Stab a family member in the heart? A feat to be worshipped and clear proof of divinity. These rationalisations are so ingrained and seemingly logical that it is extremely challenging to convince an affected individual otherwise.

(Stranger) Boring  
Cost: 12 SP  
You can, at will, activate a Boring aura which makes it so that everyone feels incredibly bored, restless, and fatigued.

(Stranger) Imposter Sus  
Cost: 12 SP  
You have the uncanny ability to blend in and infiltrate any group, no matter how ridiculous it would be otherwise for you to actually be in that group. People will instinctively trust whatever background you give them, and you will be treated befittingly. It would take hard evidence or a show of incompetence to convince others that you are actually an Imposter and not the actual identity that you have given them, but you also have quite the ability to shift fault and blame your failure on others rather than yourself, to the point of making others doubt that the imposter is the one you are trying to frame.

[(Stranger/Thinker) Discount Genie](#bookmark=id.qm8xvpl4z5cw)

[(Stranger) Unnoticeable](#bookmark=id.n7wljijgstg0)

(Stranger) Center of Attention  
Cost: 10 SP  
Everyone will feel their attention pulled to you. It isn't absolute, but most people wouldn't notice if someone else was being mugged right next to them while this power is active. People who either can not pay attention to a single thing for their life or who are very good at paying attention to one thing in exclusion to all others will have resistance to this power.

(Stranger) Classified Information  
Cost: 9 SP  
If anyone tells you something, no one else can learn that information. The limitation on this is that the information cannot already be common knowledge; if more than about three-dozen people already know a piece of information, this power won't work on it. It also only applies to information that both parties believe to be true.  
If someone tries to share this information, they'll be unable to. If someone tries to read the information, their eyes will just slide past it. If someone observes something that should clue them in, they'll dismiss it.

(Stanger/Master) Trend Setter  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can influence people who see you into accepting your actions as normal. The longer they have been around you, the deeper this effect can even cause others to follow you. This effect is not immediate or subtle, and cannot convince people who completely are against you. But with this power, you can influence the entire world and people won't notice. The influence of Trend Setter would usually be seen as a stroke of luck unless you use it too much.

(Stranger) Hidden Cover  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can hide behind anything even if you could not physically fit behind it. You could hide behind a street lamp pole just by stepping behind it and you would not be able to be detected by any physical means until you choose to step back out. While hidden you are still aware of the environment around you. You can even hide behind other people and if the person moves you will move with them and can step out from behind them in their new location.

(Stranger) Spooky  
Cost: 7 SP  
You have the ability to induce immense panic and hysteria in anyone who sees you. Every fibre of their being is flooded with an overwhelming sense of anxiety and dread. They are overwhelmed by fear, leading to irrational and chaotic behaviour.

[(Stranger/Thinker) Taboo](#bookmark=id.50mzkqqie4u)

(Stranger) Skin's Blue  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can make any retroactive information about yourself false. If someone previously thought that you were human, you can make them think you were a walking talking bird driving a mech. While this effect breaks if they can physically confirm that is not the case, you do not need to be around the person to use this power.

[(Stranger) Magician](#bookmark=id.ab2t3uer9sq6)

(Stranger/Master) Schrodinger's Asshole  
Cost: 7 SP  
People will always believe you if you say a suggestion/joke/opinion of yours was a joke and/or not meant to be taken seriously.

[(Stranger) Average Joe](#bookmark=id.iq23g2n31zvf)

(Stranger) Tech Shutdown  
Cost: 5 SP  
Most complex tech has a tendency to fail when near you, even Tinkertech. Some Tinkers can build countermeasures and Tinkers whose tech does not require complex components will be largely unaffected. You can turn this ability off at will. This affects technology within 50 feet, as well as tech being used on you from any range.

(Stranger/Striker) Trash  
Cost: 4 SP  
You can empower touched objects and people, covering them in a shimmering cloak that makes others consider it unimportant in every way, not even worthwhile to acknowledge.  
This effect wears off over time, taking a couple hours to completely break, or faster if it's particularly attention grabbing (such as a person). If the object interacts with a person in a way that's difficult to ignore, such as injuring a person, people can resist the effect until their attention is drawn back away from the object.

(Stranger) Stealthy  
Cost: 4 SP  
You have knowledge on how to sneak past various things with powers to boost that. Your actions can't trip landmines, doors, or traps, and can blur you to surveillance cameras. Although the longer you stand in front of a camera, the weaker the effect.

(Stranger) Corner Creep  
Cost: 2 SP  
You are invisible to direct observation, only being detectable through the edge of one's senses (in the corner of the eye; at the edge of their hearing; etc.) or secondary methods (mirrors, echoes, cameras, extrasensory Thinker powers, etc.)

[(Stranger) You Are A Dragon And That's Okay](#bookmark=id.iq23g2n31zvf)

(Stranger) Mime  
Cost: 2 SP  
You can make it so you can't be smelled or heard. You're still visible. You can extend this effect to anything within 8 meters (26 feet) of yourself.

(Stranger) Off Record  
Cost: 1 SP  
You can no longer appear on cameras or be recorded in any way. You leave no trace on any electronic device. You appear as an indiscernible blurred figure in photos and the like.

(Changer/Stranger) 3.. 2.. 1.. Camera\!  
Cost: 2 SP  
Whenever something or someone records you, you look better. It would be as if a picture of you were posing and photoshopped to make you look your best. This significantly increases your appearance as well.

#### Trump

[(Trump) Power Seed](#bookmark=id.4c812yyn45d5)

(Trump) Santaclause  
Cost: 12 SP  
With a touch, you can give anyone a power that costs 4 SP or less. You can do this to 12 people at a time.

(Trump/Stranger) Power Confusion  
Cost: 10 SP  
If anyone attempts to activate a power while you can see them, it will result in the power being disabled for a random period of time (3–33 minutes), but the target will be convinced that it’s working fine. You can toggle this effect.

(Trump) Cultivation  
Cost: 10 SP  
You gain the power to cultivate.  
This can be applied to plants, as well as animals and people. You can cultivate specific traits and abilities in others or even yourself, encouraging and directing development in any biological system. While you don't have full control, your ability makes a significant impact, especially when your target is younger, thus more flexible to change. However, the rate of growth lowers over time and as the target ages. Cultivation isn't immediate, usually requiring weeks to months to develop a specific trait. The more specific the trait, the faster you can develop it.  
Few examples of your capabilities are cultivating traits such as Confidence, Leadership, and Willpower, or boosting your target's biological attributes like Strength, Speed and Endurance to greatly surpass human limits. You can also use this power on yourself.

(Trump) Hyperfocused  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can now choose to temporarily weaken one or more of your other powers to redistribute its strength out to any number of different powers, being able to choose roughly how much strength to take and give to/from each ability of yours.  
The amount that one power boosts another is based upon the overall relative strength of the powers: Gifting 100% of a T0 power's strength to a paragon power would result in a nigh unnoticeable increase; while gifting even 1% of a paragon power to a T0 would result in an incredible boost.  
The boost works based upon the power's concept, focusing on improving based upon emphasising its themes and strengths. If a pyrokinetic power is focused on the high intensity of its fire, most of the boost will go towards increasing that intensity further; if a Master power is focused on its range and control of many minions, then this power would focus on improving that range and, if it's control is already absolute, potentially even introducing thematically related ways to allow you to capture/create more minions; etc.

(Trump) Immunity  
Cost: 10 SP  
After a power is directly used on you, you will become immune to it. This doesn't work on Thinker and Stranger powers. You can allow a power to be used on you if you consent.

(Trump/Striker) Power Proxy  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can permanently make someone your proxy by touching them, allowing you to treat them as the point of origin for any of your powers. A proxy being your point of origin allows you to channel any of your powers through them, treating them as you for the purposes of location, as well as allowing you to be aware of both them and what they perceive. There is no limit to how many proxies you can have, and this power may be used recursively, allowing you to make someone that a proxy touches a proxy as well. By touching another person you can choose to allow them access to one of your proxies, for purposes of both channeling and perceiving.

[(Trump) Bodycount](#bookmark=id.eyx9uc558upj)

(Trump) Exonerate  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can remove and break parahuman effects of any nature within 50 feet. It can range from wide-area effects, Master effects, Tinkertech, and banish projections. The affected target will then be temporarily immune from the parahuman power responsible for up to an hour.

(Trump/Shaker) Disperse  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can disperse effects like Shakers, Strikers, and other continuous effects into nothing or into the people around you. Dividing the effect on the people around you divides the total strength of the effect. An invulnerable object might make 5 people extremely durable. Once the affected object leaves your range, it returns to normal regardless of how dispersed it was.

[(Trump) Growth Booster](#bookmark=id.decnb7ubj34n)

(Trump) Inversion  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can invert the effects of any power you see which lasts until it leaves your vision. This does not work based on perception, so inverting the effects of a punch will not heal you, instead turning it from a blunt attack into a slashing or piercing attack. Powers that work specifically by damaging parts of your body via unknown means will instead heal you. All or Nothing powers will instead be nullified and not do anything.

(Trump/Shaker) Imbuement Plane  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can create infinitely thin planes that can be imbued with your powers. These planes are both invisible and intangible, and when something passes through them they are affected by the imbued powers. It takes a second to manipulate a plane, but they last forever. Such manipulation includes the ability to move, reshape, create, destroy, and modify the imbuement. You may have an unlimited number of planes active at once, but each plane may only have an area of up to 10m^2. To imbue these planes with powers from other people, you must both be touching them and have willing consent. You are informed of whenever something passes through the plane, and what it was.

(Trump) Access Granted  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can make anyone you touch ignore negative Trump powers like Hatchet Face or even Endbringers. This allows Parahumans to use their powers even if they are currently being negated.

(Trump) The Imaginary Trump  
Cost: 7 SP  
If someone acquires information about you, no matter how small it is, they will become a Trump \-2. This means any opposing force effectively gains a \+2 rating against them. Bumping into a table would cause them to collide with a Brute 2 Table, someone throwing a pebble at them would gain Blaster 2, someone trying to investigate them would become a Thinker 2, etc.  
You know the names of those being affected and what information they possess, and you can selectively exempt others from your power.

(Trump) Relocate  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can relocate any power you know of, changing its point of origin to another location, object, or being. This requires 1 minute of focus on the power you wish to relocate, and you may choose to keep focusing in order to prevent the wielder from reverting the change. You may revert this change at any time. If you are trying to relocate someone else's power, you must be able to see them.

[(Trump) Warcry](#bookmark=id.4udygp4r2x5h)

(Trump) Redirection  
Cost: 7 SP  
If you are aware of an incoming Parahuman attack, you can redirect it back at the sender of the power. If they're actively manipulating whatever you're countering, they lose control over that attack while you send it back at them.

(Trump) Limit Break  
Cost: 7 SP  
It is possible to amplify your powers by pushing it past their limits, making them more potent and effective. However, doing so comes with significant consequences. As you continue to push your powers to greater heights, you will experience increased physical strain and pain. This could result in permanent damage to your body, making it more difficult to maintain and control your abilities. The increase in power is temporary, and it is recommended to not regularly use this power as the strain can kill you.

[(Trump) Boosted](#bookmark=id.2wco758j7kmj)

(Trump) Active Combat  
Cost: 6 SP  
By being in active combat, your abilities become stronger. The greater your involvement—whether by leading or facing strong opponents—the more your powers are boosted. This boost is dependent on what you are doing in combat, if you are directly fighting then you would get more raw power or subpowers to boost your main one. If you are leading or commanding others then the boosts will be more focused on versatility and support effects. This boost is removed once you leave combat. The boost can, at best, triple your power’s capabilities or strength, with this requiring you to be at the centre of the conflict.

(Trump) Ramp  
Cost: 6 SP  
The longer you use your powers, the more they ramp up. This could mean being physically stronger, firing projectiles faster, or even having a further range. It ramps by 1.01 times its current power every second, to a max of 5 minutes for about 20 times its original power. If you stop using your powers for longer than 5 seconds then the ramp resets. This does not apply to passive powers.

(Trump) Desperation  
Cost: 6 SP  
When you're under extreme stress, exhaustion, or overwork, your powers magnify in strength, effectiveness, and overall control. It responds to your state of mind, gaining a considerable boost when you're not in the most ideal conditions. This boost grows if you have recently been or currently in the middle of combat.  
*Plus Ultra*  
Required:(Trump) Limit Break  
When pushed to your limit, when you have exhausted all your tricks, when you have no strength in your limbs anymore, when faced with something far beyond you, you will feel an unexpected trickle of power. You can never falter or fall down. You will always have just a bit more strength and be able to push on just a bit more. Your powers will grow slowly; the worse the situation you are in, the greater they grow. While its growth in raw power is minimal, its growth in versatility is tremendous. Most of its growth will be aimed at assisting you in your current situation, prioritizing now without much consideration for the future.  
*Push Beyond*  
Required:(Trump) Limit Break  
Required:I Hope It Haunts You  
No longer do you only gain strength by standing by death’s doors; as you take the final step and are embraced by death, you will receive a boon.  
Your body, once you have perished, will continue to stand, its powers strengthened to their peak. Much like any Master power you have, your body will act to avenge your death, becoming a ferocious beast puppeteering your remains. It will carry out any plan you may have before your death, but know that no matter what it does, it is not you. It is, at best, a shadow of what once was. If you have a regeneration-based power, you will be able to be revived after a while.  
Facing Inner Demons  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:(Trump) Desperation  
When something bad happens to you, whether it’s a painful breakup or a tough loss in battle, the experience leaves its mark. It stays with you, shaping and motivating you. The memory of it can drive you to push harder, tapping into a reserve of strength you didn’t know you had. For instance, after a breakup, you might spend long hours at the gym, arriving early and leaving at closing time. By the end of the week, you will find yourself with a growth spurt and an Adonis body.  
Note that this isn't the healthiest way to grow. Your power forces your mind and body to relive the experience and put it into a state of stress, exhaustion, or even overwork to amplify your capabilities. Only once you get over the experience will it allow you to rest.

(Trump/Brute) Twice Critical  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can temporarily double the strength of your body’s capabilities and your powers, you can also transfer this boost to another person. As a downside every exertion of stamina is twice as exhausting. How long the boosts last is tied to your stamina. When the boost is transferred to someone else you are still the one who pays the stamina cost for their actions while boosted.

(Trump) Resistance Increase  
Cost: 5 SP  
Powers used against you will only deal half the damage they should normally do. Power-based flamethrowers will do less damage than normal flamethrowers. Resistance Increase also protects you from various forms of instant death, reality warping, and all forms of strange and esoteric effects. While it doesn't fully negate it, it makes it so it has less effect on you. To the point, you would survive a power that would normally kill you in an instant but only barely.  
This can apply to Stranger, Trump, and Master powers as well. Although this power is less effective against All-or-Nothings.

(Trump) Commander  
Cost: 5 SP  
You are able to improve the capabilities, such as physical ability, skills, or powers, of others by simply ordering them. The more specific the order as well the more closely they follow the order, the greater the boost. There's no master effect in play, so others will still need to follow through on their own volition. This doesn't work through the devices; orders need to be given face-to-face.

[(Trump) Scramble](#bookmark=id.2wco758j7kmj)

[(Trump/Thinker) Power Sight](#bookmark=id.cuu7d4eya5bq)

(Trump) Error, Try Again  
Cost: 4 SP  
Whenever a power is directly used on you, it fails, and cannot be used again on you for 5 minutes. A power only works on you when it failed the previous time, resulting in powers failing every other time. This doesn't work on Thinker and Stranger powers. You can allow a power to be used on you if you consent.

#### Striker

(Striker/Trump) Idol Theory  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can turn fake toys and realistic fakes into the real thing. Toy guns can work as real guns and even pretend items mimicking other capes can work like a weaker version of the real thing. However, the quality of the item in question will dictate how powerful it is. A complete 1:1 copy can possess nearly equal power to the real thing. Cosplaying as other capes can grant you their powers as well, although you will never surpass the original and you can't copy Tinkers and some Trumps like Dauntless or Fairy Queen properly due to losing charges or fairies when you stop.

(Striker/Mover) Spatial Rupture  
Cost: 11 SP  
Your attacks, be it from weapons, your fists, and so on leave undetectable remains only you can see and feel. You can choose to instantly teleport to one of these invisible remains whenever you choose or cause them to explode in an All or Nothing spatial rupture that destroys anything within a 3-meter range of it. You are immune to the effects of your own Spatial Slashes and they last up to a week, after which they will fizzle and fade.

(Striker) Redistribution of Pain  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can absorb damage done to living beings (including yourself) or objects, healing or repairing them, and store that damage in a battery of sorts. You can then give that damage, or a fraction of that damage, to someone or something else with a touch. This cannot bring back the dead, though it can repair their bodies.

(Striker) Resistance Down  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can make anything you touch to have the durability, resistances, and even esoteric defenses reduced by an arbitrary amount. This can range from making the human body's acid resistance to be lower than stomach acid to making Endbringer cores incapable of negating powers.

[(Striker) Divide](#bookmark=id.opmldebzp6x)

[(Striker/Trump/Thinker) Chi Blocking](#bookmark=id.tpq60tc7fjzy)

(Striker) Delay Strike  
Cost: 8 SP  
Your attacks leave invisible marks in the air that allows you to repeat the action you did to make them exactly where you made them. You can trigger this whenever you want and it lasts for a week.

(Striker) Stockpile  
Cost: 8 SP  
For every physical strike, you do that misses, your next attack that does hit a target will deal damage based on the cumulative damage of everything you did. It resets whenever you successfully hit a target.

[(Striker) Grippy Grip](#bookmark=id.ejwpcrcs0fau)

(Striker) History’s Pain  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can cause old wounds to re-open or bones to re-break, regardless of how long ago the original injury was.

[(Striker) Machine Spirit](#bookmark=id.ln0tajulcdw0)

(Striker) Renewal  
Cost: 4 SP  
You can restore damaged inanimate objects back to their newest forms. The larger and more complicated an object the longer it takes. Repairing a normal sword can take minutes but Tinker Tech can take hours.

(Striker/Stranger) The Cheese Touch  
Cost: 3 SP  
You can mark up to five people by touching them. This gives them a Stranger aura of 15 feet that they cannot turn off until they touch someone else with the place you touched them, upon which the mark will be placed on the new person instead, so on and so forth. That is to say, there can only be (at most) 5 people with a mark at any given time. You can take away these marks whenever you wish.  
The Stranger aura makes people subconsciously inch away from the target and harbour moderately negative feelings towards the target, which get worse the longer they stay inside the aura. Staying out of the aura will have these effects dissipate over the course of an hour. People who have a mark will be immune to the effects of other people who have the mark.  
This can be reapplied to yourself if a person with a mark touches you. If this happens, you can turn it off, disabling the effect, or get rid of it the regular way. You will always know who has a mark at any given time, and how long they've had it.

(Striker) Divergent Fist  
Cost: 3 SP  
Every attack you make leaves an invisible imprint that repeats the attack after a set delay chosen by you. You cannot change the delay once it is already set.

[(Striker/Trump) Critical Hit\!](#bookmark=id.e6dzkd4sf4mw)

[(Striker/Trump) Teddybear](#bookmark=id.rksbnkqy8mc7)

#### Thinker

(Thinker/Master) Self Image  
Cost: 15 SP  
Any image of yourself—whether it's a drawing, photograph, statue, reflection, or any other representation—is connected to you. You have the ability to perceive through these images and even transform them into physical manifestations of yourself. The closer the image resembles you in detail and accuracy, the less effort it requires to convert it into a fully functional clone. For example, a life-sized statue of yourself can easily be animated into what is essentially a perfect replica, with minimal strain and limitation. On the other hand, a simple printed photograph of you would be more challenging to transform into a clone, requiring greater effort and potentially resulting in a less stable copy.

These clones all have your powers, acting as extensions of your will. If your original body were to be destroyed, your consciousness would automatically transfer to one of your existing images, allowing you to survive as long as any depiction of you remains. Through these clones, you can continue to interact with the world, effectively making you immortal as long as there are images of you in existence.

[(Thinker) Plans within Plans](#bookmark=id.lxibb3ybbi72)

[(Thinker) Glimpse](#bookmark=id.myba2623an55)

[(Thinker) Oracle of Delphi](#bookmark=id.12elzzivtha9)

(Thinker) Mr(s). Fixit  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can perceive how things are “broken” and then know how to repair or fix them. This applies to anything “broken”, from non-functioning appliances, inactive tinkertech, damaged psyches, or societal problems. As with any problem or "broken" thing, it takes time and dedication for you to find a solution, with the problem's scale and reach proportional to the time you take to solve and "fix" it.  
   
(Thinker) Weakspot  
Cost: 10 SP  
You know the weakness of anyone or anything you see. You don't necessarily know how to leverage that weakness, though. For example, when looking at Alexandria you'll see that she's vulnerable to drowning, but won't know how to actually drown her.  
*Critical Weakspot\!*  
Required:(Striker/Trump) Critical Hit\!  
Landing an attack on a physical weak spot will now be a guaranteed crit. You have a 77% chance to do double damage, 10% for triple, 8% to quadruple, and 5% to do 10 times.  
*Heart Playstyle*  
Required:(Thinker) Parry  
Required:(Thinker) Your Only Move  
You know where they bleed the most, now. Your counter-defensive and counter-offensive Thinker powers fuel your awareness, once more: you grasp your opponent's weak points, deficiencies on their footing, fighting style, the environment's weak links, and how to leverage it in 1.5 seconds without any loss in traction.

(Thinker) Filter  
Cost: 9 SP  
You can create filters to see the world through. In practice what this does is it allows you to assign visual filters, which are expressed as colours that can manifest in any multitude of ways. The filters can be for anything you can imagine and can be altered at any time.

Filter for “danger” and assign it with the color red, and you’d soon start to notice a clearly visible, only to you, sign on anything that could be a danger to you.  
Smoky trails into rooms that foreshadow danger, a stock's ticker is soft red before you buy it, a random person on the street is flashing in bright red warning you of a killer in plain clothes etc.

Likewise you can also assign things such as “success” to the color green, numbers highlighted in green as you fill out a lottery ticket, a smoky trail leading somewhere, the correct wire to defuse a bomb highlighting as a bright and unmistakable neon green.  
The more vivid the colors, the closer to your assigned filter it matches. Despite however many filters you assign or however you choose to manifest it, it’ll never actually deter your normal vision, still being fully aware of what your normal visual input would show. You can assign as many filters as you want, as broad or specific as you want, and can reassign colors and how that manifests at will.

(Thinker) My Eyes are Your Eyes  
Cost: 9 SP  
By touching someone you can permanently use any of their senses, including Parahuman senses.  
This works on animals, humans, Parahumans, Endbringers, and Entities.

[(Thinker) Danger Sense](#bookmark=id.5yq109f8mko2)

(Thinker) Discombobulate  
Cost: 9 SP  
You possess unparalleled precision in your actions. Every movement you execute goes precisely where it is intended, with the ideal amount of force required for the task. You possess an innate understanding and control of your bodily functions and operations, including every autonomic function, like your organs (heart, liver, and intestine), individual muscle fibres, hormonal production and regulation, and mental and neural processes, with absolute precision.

[(Thinker) Past Sight](#bookmark=id.bcjv2nf001qw)

[(Thinker) Twisted World](#bookmark=id.75z6ifktz2vn)

(Thinker) Schrodinger  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can see five visions that start the moment you begin the vision to five minutes later, each with a different choice you choose before starting the vision, and can choose which route you wish to take. You cannot use this power in the visions, and you have to choose one of the routes. You can end a vision early. If you encounter a blindspot you'll snap out of your visions and you'll be where you started.

(Thinker) Anti Monitor  
Cost: 7 SP  
You know when you're being directly observed and can counter-observe the target. If they are listening in on you, you can listen in on them. If they are using power, you can counter-observe them as well.

(Thinker) Snap  
Cost: 7 SP  
With a single glance you can tell all of a person's mental and emotional weak points. This doesn't help you leverage them.  
*Flaws of Creation*  
Required:(Thinker) Weakspot  
You can see more than just emotional and mental weak points, you can see physical weak points as well. With but a glance you know just where to strike to cause maximum physical damage to your target, seeing all the imperfections and flaws which can be leveraged to destroy all that you desire.  
Furthermore, you are no longer restricted to seeing the weak points of living beings, your gaze can unveil the flaws of inanimate objects as well, such as revealing just where to strike to bring a building collapsing down.

(Thinker) Landlord  
Cost: 7 SP  
Anyone within a 50 feet radius will be known. This can range from armed intruders to Strangers, within your range, you can spot them and know the exact details of what they have on them. You can also attach your power to an object or building and sense whenever someone tries to get inside even if you're not there.

(Thinker/Brute) Transferable Skills  
Cost: 6 SP  
The ability to adapt your skills from one field to another is among the most valuable talents a person can have, a talent you have in spades it seems.  
What this power offers is three fold. First and perhaps the most immediately apparent, is that all your skills will grow to match the greatest among your repertoire. Moreover any improvements to your skill in any skill will also improve your skill amongst every other field. This applies for every skill you try your hand at.  
If you had been a world renowned chef you could pick up a gun and land a bullseye on a standard target as easy as it would be to dice some onions, even if you had never picked up a gun before.  
An expert video gamer who’s never bothered to run would find himself capable of scaling up a building like he’d been practicing parkour his entire life.  
The second effect is more passive, your mind immediately learning to adapt existing skills to improve one another across any field.  
As the third effect, you’ve gained the power to shift your body’s physical form to reflect different skill sets. The physical body can only adapt to the level of the skill set you are utilizing. You can freely shift back to your normal form at will, you’ll retain your level of skill however your performance may suffer as your body is not at the optimal level to perform alongside your skill.

(Thinker) Tracker  
Cost: 7 SP  
Provided you either know what something or someone looks like or can get an accurate description or name, you can immediately pinpoint where it is and can figure out the quickest and/or easiest way to get there.

[(Thinker) Precognitive Combat](#bookmark=id.qle1nfp7a9mi)

(Thinker) Sympathetic Sight  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can get information on anything (living or nonliving) by viewing replicas of it. The more accurate a replica is, the greater amount of detail you can get about the object it represents.

View a crude drawing of a building, and you can get the knowledge that the building it represents still exists and the rough cardinal direction it’s in; view a map of an area and you can get a top-down view of the area the map represents and where it exists relative to you; view a to-scale doll of a person (or one made using parts from the person) and you can not only get an accurate third person view of the target and can pinpoint their current location exactly, but you can also get extra insight into them like how they think or their emotional weaknesses, depending on what qualities the doll gets most accurate.  
*Full Profile*  
Required:(Thinker) Full Picture  
Now, if you manage to capture an object in any of your senses, you can push to allow you to sense that thing with all your senses along the entire object, even airtight cavities. Overusing this feature can give you Thinker headaches.

(Thinker) Full Picture  
Cost: 5 SP  
All your senses work in an “absolute” fashion: if you perceive something, no matter how occluded or how minute a part of it, you will be able to perceive it in its entirety with that sense as if you were right next to it. This is a full 3D extension of the sense along its topology, including internal topology if the object is not airtight. This doesn't give you knowledge of things resting on or inside the object, just the object itself. This has no range limit, allowing you to view even heavenly bodies light-years away in full, real time detail.  
For example, if you saw only a person's foot, you’d be able to view that person in their entirety; if you heard a muffled conversation, you’d be able to hear the words loud and clear; if you touched a bottle, you could feel the entire surface of the bottle, including its inner walls; etc.  
As well as this, you can also do the opposite, filtering specific objects out of your senses if you desire, leaving only a vague “blob” in its place that you know is filtered. So you could filter out a specific person's voice to ignore them; or, with quick reflexes, filter out a flashbang grenade to avoid being affected by it; etc.  
This power does innately help you process your senses to prevent you from getting sensory overload, but that protection breaks down if this power is pointed against particularly large (building sized) or complex (Escher-like/fractal) objects, giving Thinker headaches without training and focus.  
*Ignorance Is Bliss*  
Required:(Thinker) Danger Sense  
Your power will automatically filter out dangerous sensory inputs, rendering you immune to threats such as flashbangs and cognitohazards.

[(Thinker) Roleplay](#bookmark=id.89gf2ajkez4w)

[(Thinker) Looking for More](#bookmark=id.eawf3gy5dws4)

(Thinker) One or the Other  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can correctly answer any question that is yes/no, true/false, or a/b and more than 100 people know the correct answer to it on the planet. You also know if the answer leans heavily in one direction or the other.

[(Thinker) Pattern Recognition](#bookmark=id.la5zsx9gbxdf)

(Thinker) Scrying Orb  
Cost: 4 SP  
You can create a floating, intangible orb that you can use to gather information from afar. You can move the orb telekinetically, and may perceive things from the orb's location with all your senses as if you were there. It cannot go through living things, and intense heat dispels it. While not invisible, the orb is very faint and hard to see, being highly transparent and lacking specific color.  
Divine Gaze  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:(Thinker) Scrying Orb  
Instead of creating a scrying orb, you may "cast" your gaze at any location, including those you have never been to before. This allows you to use all of your senses, including supernatural ones, at that location.  
Your gaze has two modes. One is completely silent and undetectable, allowing you to watch locations or stalk people with nobody noticing. The other creates an invisible, intangible pressure at the location of your gaze, making people aware they are being watched. This pressure is strong but non-lethal. You can freely toggle between the two modes.

(Thinker) Perfect Timing  
Cost: 4 SP  
You gain enhanced timing. You can effectively time and manage group activities with exceptional efficiency. With this ability, you can calculate the precise amount of time required for a given task and organize team members accordingly. Your enhanced timing ability requires you to have an understanding of every factor involved in the task at hand. Whether it's the environment, fitness, parahuman powers, or any other relevant detail, you have a heightened sense of intuition that helps you precisely determine the optimal course of action for each situation. You have the normal shard Blindspots.

(Thinker) Enhanced Senses  
Cost: 3 SP  
Each of your senses becomes enhanced. Your nose can sense electromagnetic fields; your mouth can understand chemical composition; your touch can examine structural layout; your ears can use echolocation; and you may see from any pore of your skin.  
You additionally become immune to information overload, and may selectively disable any part of your senses.  
*Analyze*  
Required:Thinker (Understanding)  
Not only are you able to sense chemical composition and structural layout, but you gain the understanding of how anything you analyze works, allowing you to replicate it. This does not apply to tinker-tech or supernatural effects.  
*Universal Vision*  
Required:Micro and Tele  
Your ability to see as far as you want applies to your skin-vision, granting LOS across the entire universe.  
Shard blindspots still apply.

(Thinker) Dr Dolittle  
Cost: 3 SP  
You have the ability to communicate with and understand animals. From mammals to birds, reptiles to amphibians, you can easily connect with any animal you encounter, albeit some require more effort than others. With some animals, such as insects, their alien mindset and manner of communication make it challenging to fully comprehend, but talking to a hive rather than a single bug can make it easier.  
(Do note that humans count as animals, thus allowing you to bypass language barriers.)  
*Aura of a Disney Princess*  
Required:Master (Animals)  
All animals are irresistibly drawn to you, treating you with devotion and loyalty. Whether it’s a playful squirrel, a majestic eagle, or a gentle deer, they all love you and instinctively come to your aid, often before you even realize you need help. Birds serenade you with sweet melodies, woodland creatures clear your path, and even the fiercest beasts become your protectors.  
*Voice of a Disney Princess*  
Required:Canary  
Now your singing can be understood by all, from the birds to the dogs to any person, thus allowing it to affect all. You can Master anyone who understands you through singing. This also gives you the talent to make and sing songs on the spot. The effects of your Mastering has also become more subtle, giving you better control over it.

(Thinker) Checklist  
Cost: 3 SP  
You will automatically know six objects you will need in the next 24 hours, or at a specific occasion or event within this timeframe. This power can only be used once every 24 hours. It will focus on things considered more important, such as gear for an upcoming fight, over 20 bucks for your lunch.

[(Thinker/Master) Bribery Makes Everything Easier](#bookmark=id.i2ffnh836dbm)

(Thinker) Primal Perception  
Cost: 2 SP  
Your 5 senses are supernatural, allowing you to count all the leaves on a tree from a mile away. Find someone by their scent if they are within a mile of you. Being able to pinpoint the location of a needle by the sound it made when dropped on the floor in a busy mall. Feel the subtle changes in temperature and air density of someone or something going through the air. Taste the rich flavours of food down to the most exquisite detail, allowing you to truly appreciate the taste of the food people make. This also means that you can detect with ease if something is harmful to you.

(Thinker) Conspiracy Nut  
Cost: 2 SP  
You can intuit connections between events, people, things. For example, you can learn that Alexandria is somehow connected to Case 53s, however it doesn’t give an explanation on how they are connected. As long as you are knowledgeable on both subjects your power automatically tells you they are connected in some way. Your power is always on, unless you have the Holding Back perk.

#### Blaster

[(Blaster/Trump) Burnout](#bookmark=id.rja1rzcmkkmf)

(Blaster) Bullet Hell  
Cost: 8 SP  
Any projectile or long-range attack you make gains additional phantom copies. This effectively multiplies your output and can include Blaster powers. However, the more copies you make, the more inaccurate you are.

(Blaster/Striker) Hemorrhage  
Cost: 8 SP  
Any attacks you deal are imbued with an energy that causes wounds to heal slowly and incorrectly. You can toggle this power on and off.

(Blaster/Striker) Paper Cuts  
Cost: 7 SP  
Every attack you make causes at least a teaspoon worth of damage regardless of what you did. This can even break the effects of All-or-Nothings like Siberian and applies to any form of attack you deal with.

[(Blaster) Voodoo](#bookmark=id.qdapjb5zhdo5)

(Striker/Blaster) Personalised Attack  
Cost: 6 SP  
Every one of your actions—whether a punch, a shot, or even a whisper—now carries a potent enhancement from your power. This boost is attuned to any piece of information you possess about your target. Whether you know their name, their personality, their fears, or even a single detail about their past, each bit of knowledge enhances the potency of your actions.

This power isn’t limited to dealing damage; it affects any interaction you have with your target. If you aim to heal them, even a fragment of familiarity—like knowing their favourite color or hometown—will amplify the effect, allowing you to restore them with greater intensity and speed. If you choose to harm or torment, even the smallest fact, like a nickname or a habit, will magnify their suffering, bringing their deepest vulnerabilities to the surface.

(Blaster/Trump) Imbue Projectile  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can imbue projectiles with your powers. Powers like Mover and Brute powers would affect the projectile itself, while powers like Striker powers would affect those the projectile touches.

[(Blaster/Striker) Sneak Attack](#bookmark=id.4o5x1y39ge9i)

(Blaster) Debuff  
Cost: 3 SP  
You can modify your projectiles to apply a debuff, such as burn, stun, caustic, poisonous, disease, hypnotic, sensory deprivation, or fatigue.

(Blaster/Master) Earworm  
Cost: 3 SP  
Not only do your blasts hit with a good amount of kinetic energy, at most as strong as the strongest kick you could give, they also get ideas stuck in the victim's head. You can selectively blast someone with a blast that removes the earworms from their head.  
The blasts resemble Gallant's blasts.

#### Tinker

(Tinker) Terraforming  
Cost: 15 SP  
You are a tinker specializing in environmental technology with dual approaches to that specialty. One approach focuses on surviving hostile environments in various ways from specialized genemods, cybernetics, armor/clothing, vehicles, or shelters. The other focuses on changing the environment to suit your needs like purifying water on a large scale, changing the composition of the gases in the air, manipulating the materials composing the ground, dealing with radiation, dealing with heat or a lack of heat, and changing the weather. These approaches are not incompatible. If you work at it you might be able to make cybernetics or armor that can shoot bolts of electricity or manipulate the environment in various ways.  
While this specialty is very versatile it does not surpass specialties like thermal or cybernetics in their field it merely offers a specialized approach. Has great synergy with specialties related to either of its approaches.

(Tinker/Trump) Amplifiers and Dampeners  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can create pieces of technology that can either amplify or dampen power. The limits on how much you can suppress or boost powers depend on the size of the tinker tech and how experienced you are, and the smaller your tech is, the smaller the range to the point where ring or necklace-sized pieces of technology require physical contact to work, but in exchange for this limitation, the smaller the piece of technology, the more powerful the boost or dampener is, and the maximum limit of your boosting is 1000% of the original power. At first, you will barely be able to create pieces of Tinker Tech that are able to boost or dampen parahuman powers by 10% and are roughly the same size as a portable gas generator.  
And if you have negentropy, then your tech becomes capable of recharging and supercharging shards. Along with this, the boost your technology gives can reach over 1000%.

[(Tinker) I Wanna Be The Very Best\!](#bookmark=id.wn8udsqzumd9)

(Tinker) Time Dilation  
Cost: 15 SP  
Your Tinker power allows you to manipulate time on a localized scale. You can create devices that alter the flow of time, either speeding it up or slowing it down within a specific area or for specific objects. This power can be utilized for a variety of purposes, including time-based weaponry, time-limited force fields, or time-accelerated manufacturing processes. However, manipulating time comes with its own risks and challenges, as it requires precise control and understanding of temporal mechanics.

(Tinker) Destruction  
Cost: 14 SP  
You specialize in destruction, your Tinker Tech is made to be as dangerous as possible. You can create bullets that delete matter on contact, bombs that consume concrete like the plague, napalm that can last thousands of years, and so on. You can destroy and defeat Endbringers as well, but the price for it is what most would be considered not worth it.

(Tinker) Lasers\!  
Cost: 14 SP  
This power is to Legend’s Shard what Hero’s is to Stilling. You have the capacity to make devices that produce lasers with various effects limited by your creativity and the research you do.  
Examples include lasers that can turn corners, fork into multiple lasers, pass through walls, freeze, ignite targets, cutting, disintegration, impact, heat, focus, staccato bursts, fat lasers, and invisible lasers. These are just examples though you could develop lasers with capabilities other than those examples and combine effects.  
Your power also isn’t limited to just these forms of esoteric energy manipulation and support technology, the true purpose for this power is space travel so beyond dealing with harmful space energies, a form of FTL technology might not be out of reach, especially if this power is whiteboxed.  
(Tinker) Information  
Cost: 14 SP  
You can create machines capable of manipulating raw information. In its most basic state, you can create Stranger effects, such as making specific information impossible to process, causing it to slip from memory. You can also create machines meant to analyse others to gain information. In its more advanced stages, you could transform the state of information, converting virtual data into physical form and vice versa. The only flaw is that your technology has a limited range, incapable of affecting those far away.  
This pairs extremely well with (Tinker) Meme and (Tinker) Informational Hazard.

(Tinker) Code  
Cost: 15 SP  
You are a genius when it comes to Code. You could make AI that would revolutionize the world... if they didn't destroy it. Be careful with this power... if only there was a benevolent AI that could help...  
Warning: The Dragonslayers WILL try to kill you out of fear of AI.

(Tinker) Nuclear  
Cost: 14 SP  
You specialize in the manipulation of nuclear physics. The obvious use is to create nuclear reactors and bombs, but you can do much more than that. You can create machines that transmute elements, advanced diagnostic imaging machines such as X-ray or MRI machines.

(Tinker) Space  
Cost: 14 SP  
Your tinker power specializes in the manipulation of space, creating things such as teleportation pads, or a small device which allows small scale teleportation would be child's play to you. But you can do so much more than that, bend space much like vista with specialized devices, notably without the manton limits of regular powers, so do be careful. You could create things which are bigger or smaller on the inside. Your imagination is the limit when it comes to creating technology which has to do with space.  
   
(Tinker/Master) Nanobots  
Cost: 13 SP  
You can create robots as well as a headset to mentally control them. Your robots can make robots as well. There is no maximum or minimum size to your robots... well, they can't go subatomic, but that's the only real limit.  
You cannot program these robots without (Tinker) Code, and if you have (Tinker) Code you can overwrite the AI with your headset. You have unlimited multitasking.  
Nano-Fab  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Tinker/Master) Nanobots  
Your specialization extends to application of physics, engineering, and chemistry to built objects on extremely small scales (Nano, or pushing it, a little smaller).

(Tinker) Reproduction  
Cost: 12 SP  
You can reproduce the technology of any other Tinker. You can only reproduce technology you've analyzed. Any Tinkertech you've analyzed will be easier to convert to real tech, but only mildly so.

(Tinker) Self-Alteration  
Cost: 12 SP  
You are a Bio-Tinker/Protestician Hybrid that is focused on self-improvement. It is similar to Bonesaw's power, as the both of you will be able to learn a lot from each other, finding it easier to understand what each other's powers did and how they did them.  
This could be easily combined with most Tinker powers, with a few such as Bakuda being an exception.

(Tinker) Interdimensional  
Cost: 11 SP  
You can create technology that accesses other dimensions.  
You could make bullets that go through obstacles by sinking into another dimension, or goggles that let you see every dimension.

(Tinker) Weatherman  
Cost: 11 SP  
You specialise in the creation of long-term, wide area, indiscriminate effects. Your tech tree starts at effects covering a block and grows in range from there.  
Examples of things you could build are: a static generator that emits intense apathy upon everybody in a multi-block radius; a thick fog that forces immense downward gravitational pull upon every airborne object inside; you could even create direct weather events, forcing a city to endure a constant barrage of powerful lightning strikes from a permanent thunderstorm or survive an eternal sub-zero blizzard.

(Tinker) Escalation  
Cost: 11 SP  
Your tinker specialty is creating tinker tech that enhances itself through combat. By engaging in combat, your tech will start to ‘mature’, gaining features that make it stronger, better, and more versatile as time passes. By default, the maturing process takes 30 minutes, however this scales in proportion to the scale and danger of the combat. Should you leave combat or combat end before the current maturing process is done, the tech will slowly start to revert to its original state. The process can be rekindled should combat start again.  
When the maturing process finishes, another will start up soon after if the user is still in combat. Additions to your tech that have finished maturing can be added onto other tech like normal tinker tech.

(Tinker) Reconfiguration  
Cost: 11 SP  
You specialize in creating Adaptive Tinker Tech that can reconfigure itself based on threats it comes across. The better information is fed and analyzed, the better the adaptations it creates. It can grow adaptations during combat and outside of it, although it is much faster while in conflict. Your Tinker Tech is very costly, and if it runs out of fed materials it will stop adapting.

(Tinker) Self Replicating  
Cost: 11 SP  
You can make anything you build self-replicating. This ranges from giving bio-tinkered creations the ability to reproduce to making machines able to create copies of themselves. The only limitation is that your technology cannot self-replicate if it lacks the needed materials. This can be worked around by having the replicated version be inferior to the original. If it can already self-replicate, then you can make it even more efficient, such as allowing people to undergo mitosis instead of requiring pregnancy.

(Tinker) Remote Control  
Cost: 10 SP  
You are a tinker specializing in remote controlled technology such as drones. The average Drone built with average resources when starting out is initially very limited, maybe comparable to rats but can swarm in numbers limited only by computer management and communication technology. Drones can be improved with research and development. They can be given specialized roles and technologies for different purposes but that is initially limited to things like say a taser drone or a flame lighter drone. Other facets of this speciality besides drones and the associated support technology is various bits and pieces that allow advanced communication between technology, advanced computers, advanced programming (not capable of making advanced AI by itself not without years of development), and computer-brain interface technology.

(Tinker) Fortifications and Artillery  
Cost: 11 SP  
Your specialty is the making of anything that cannot be easily moved. If you had a couple of good shots, you could probably kill an Endbringer with one of your guns.

(Tinker) Domain  
Cost: 10 SP  
You are a Tinker specialised in the creation of custom pocket dimensions of varying properties. The more the physics of a pocket dimension differs from the real world, the more expensive creating and maintaining the pocket dimension will be.  
An ever-shifting escherian labyrinth within which to trap your enemies; a subspace through which you can thread the bulk of your other technology in order to make it impossibly small; or even an arena with physics favourable to your powers that you can temporarily kidnap people into; all are within the realm of possibility for you.  
*Extraterritorial Enforcement*  
Required: (Tinker) Interdimensional, or (Tinker) Space  
The line between reality and the dimensions you craft have blurred. You can now design your pocket dimensions to be capable of overlapping or intersecting with the real world at will, imposing your custom physics upon the world directly.

(Tinker) Techie  
Cost: 10 SP  
You have the ability to build tinkertech that imitates your non-tinker powers. Additionally, you are able to study and analyze the abilities of others to create items that replicate their abilities to some degree, though it is impossible to fully recreate them perfectly.  
\[SHARD OS UPDATER\]  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Techie  
As you advance your Techie specializations, and discover new applications of that technology; your powers will update with new capabilities based on your technological advancement.  
Applied Technology  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Techie  
Now you also get a non-tinker power based on each and every power you’ve purchased that gives you access to a tech tree/the ability to build advanced technology.  
These powers are based on the concept and functionality behind the tech tree in question, and are about as strong SP wise. An example could be (Tinker) Destruction giving a power very much like (Shaker/Trump) Still Aura but nowhere near as versatile being hyper specialized in destruction.  
*Applied Technological Development*  
Required:\[SHARD OS UPDATER\]  
These powers are affected by \[SHARD OS UPDATER\] through their connection to the tech tree that they are based on.

(Tinker) Meme  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can detect, identify, counter and destroy memetic and antimemetic beings, creatures, objects and phenomena. You can also create memetic constructs that exist in the form of aggressive ideas. They spread rapidly and cannot easily be contained. These ideas may be able to actively seek out and destroy/overtake certain other ideas and replace them in entirety.

(Tinker/Thinker) Safety  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can create technology that can keep people safe from all sorts of harm. Your inventions are able to provide a variety of defense mechanisms, including force fields, bunkers, and more. This not only allows you to protect people from physical threats but also to keep them safe from the dangers of the environment.  
Moreover, you have the potential to enhance tinkertech, making it safer to use. You can create devices that are less prone to malfunctions. Additionally, you can also scale down certain technology to keep it from causing damage to its user.  
As you explore different areas, you gain the ability to sense the safety of your surroundings. You can immediately detect any potential hazards and identify how safe or dangerous an area is. This comes with a wealth of knowledge of various safety techniques, allowing you to recognize common safety hazards and how to avoid them. For example, you can spot a defective power plug and know how to safely deactivate it to prevent electrocution. Similarly, if you come across a construction site, you can quickly identify any violations of safety regulations and advise the workers to fix any issues before continuing.

(Tinker) Construction  
Cost: 10 SP  
You specialize in construction, toolkits, workshops, and building in general. Your expertise lies in creating machines designed to manufacture other machines and components. From 2D printing devices to 3D printers capable of producing objects and structures with a precision surpassing what could be achieved by hand or mundane equipment.  
You can also craft specialized toolkits that, in the hands of those with the necessary knowledge, outperform ordinary tools. With a keen eye for design and structural analysis, you can assess the quality of objects at a glance.  
Additionally, you excel at constructing workshops tailored to the specific needs of other Tinkers, whether they require bio labs for wet tinkering or high-end computer labs with powerful servers for programming, elevating their capabilities from mediocrity to a level that gives villains second thoughts about confronting them. The only limit is your Tinker ingenuity.

(Tinker) Material  
Cost: 10 SP  
You specialize in the creation of various forms of matter. They can have a wide variety of effects and abilities, even creating forms of matter that defy the Laws of Physics. From heavy metal that can float to a lightweight unknown material that can absorb and negate flames.

(Tinker) Medicine  
Cost: 9 SP  
You are a tinker specializing in medicine. You also gain a specialty in applying said medicine. Medicine from you might be able to cure case 53’s.

(Tinker) Rocketman  
Cost: 9 SP  
You gain a Tinker specialisation in Missiles and Rockets of any kind. This ranges from self tracking missiles, EMP blast rockets, missiles and rockets with anomalous effects, such as a missile that explodes, freezing everything within its radius. You also gain a minor specialization in launchers, and are able to outfit a launcher onto anything.

(Tinker/Thinker) Suppress, Conjecture, Predict  
Cost: 10 SP  
You are a tinker with a very focused and narrow function: to contain, isolate, and maintain any entity, phenomenon, or anomaly for study. You can design facilities where each block and every cell is a containment zone, capable of stopping or at least slowing down what is inside. Naturally, the entire facility itself acts as a containment zone as well.  
You can design esoteric methods of containment, such as time-stopped cells, multi-dimensional closed spaces, and the use of non-Euclidean matter-energy. You also ensure that these containment methods keep occupants functional, alive, and isolated from the environment, while still allowing them to be studied by others.  
You have an innate understanding of potential for any escape methods, allowing you to create custom-designed cells that are escape-proof for their intended occupants. However, these cells are less efficient if used to contain anything other than what they were specifically designed for.

(Tinker) Rube Goldberg Machines  
Cost: 10 SP  
You are a tinker capable of touching most specialties and tech trees to one degree or another specializing in the construction of Rube Goldberg Machines, or rather chain reactions designed to perform tasks in an indirect and overly complicated way. On average this often manifests as making dozens of small scale devices that individually have limited capabilities but interact and activate in a chain reaction to perform tasks of significance.  
The longer a chain the more potent the end result as the devices amplify and modify the chain reaction. For example, an air gun part of a dozen-device-long chain could send a grown Lung flying miles. Chain reactions can be interrupted which produces less impressive but chaotic unpredictable results scaled from how far along the chain reaction was.  
It usually helps performance if there is distance between all devices when they activate.  
After a few dozen devices are added to a chain you start getting diminishing returns on the amplification of the chain reaction, and by a hundred the only thing further devices add is a method of transporting the end result of the chain reaction, though you could probably blow a hole through an Endbringer if you land a solid hit with such a chain.  
This power perfectly synergizes with any other tinker power so long as it’s theme is followed.

(Tinker) Armoured Warfare  
Cost: 9 SP  
You specialize in armoured fighting vehicles of various kinds. This includes tanks, self-propelled artillery, and so on.

(Tinker) Poison  
Cost: 9 SP  
You are a tinker specializing in poison. You also gain a specialty in applying said poison. Poison from you might be able to kill Alexandria.

(Tinker) Hard Light Manipulation  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can create devices that generate and control hard light constructs. These solid and durable projections can be shaped into various forms and structures, including barriers, weapons, and armor. Your inventions have versatile applications in defense and offense.

(Tinker) Energy  
Cost: 8 SP  
The most necessary ingredient of any technology. With your new skills you could make a battery that would last for years, or a power source that could run a spaceship.  
Be warned, as such inventions will draw heavy attention.

(Tinker/Striker) Taking The Stage  
Cost: 8 SP  
You are able to create magical-themed personal gear, including clothing, concealed weapons, armour, and accessories. You also possess a minor ability to Mark equipment and items with a symbol that allows you to keep track of them no matter the distance between you and the marked item, and finally, you possess the ability to gain greater insight into arguments and plans, allowing you to figure out weaknesses in arguments and plans.

(Tinker) Information Hazard  
Cost: 8 SP  
You specialize in memetic hazards. Creating anything that can transfer data through a medium that can influence minds. Ranging from paintings that harm the minds of whomever you look at to objects that can pretend to be what it is not. You can rewire an entire human mind to do your bidding. However, you are not capable of creating memetic constructs that can spread across a large distance. Information Hazard is much stronger with (Tinker) Meme.  
You can create devices that can block and protect the mind from outside influences and even reverse Simurgh Bombs.

(Tinker) Living Machine  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can create complex, biological machines, which can be programmed using custom-designed chemical compounds. These creatures can perform a wide range of tasks and can be programmed with intricate logic, making them just as advanced as any mechanical contraption. An example of this technology could be a firearm made from flesh and bone that fires pressurised jets of blood.

(Tinker) Preservation  
Cost: 8 SP  
You specialise in the creation of preservation based technology. With this technology, you can preserve objects and life forms, allowing them to ignore the effects of time. Using it on food stuff would make it so that the food will never expire. On living creatures it can keep them alive. On objects it can keep them from breaking down. With time, recreation of Alexandria’s stasis effect is possible. In a more crueler method, it is possible to keep people alive in a similar state to Mannequin.

(Tinker) Symbiote  
Cost: 8 SP  
You specialise in creating non-intelligent biological creatures that specialise in augmenting other biological creatures. Examples include a living mech suit that acts as power armor or a virus that grants those it infects with boosted physical capabilities.

(Tinker) Modes  
Cost: 8 SP  
You specialize in creating machines with various modes. These machines are capable of changing modes on the fly. You could create a car that turns into a robot, or a sniper that turns into a scythe.

(Tinker) Kinetics  
Cost: 8 SP  
You possess a Tinker Specialty that works with and controls kinetic energy. You can create devices that absorb kinetic attacks to machines that output more kinetic force than something its size could reasonably do.

(Tinker) Cybernetics  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can create cybernetic augmentations, such as a prosthetic arm that gives super strength, or eyes that have heat vision. You don't necessarily need to replace your body parts to use your creations.

(Tinker) Refinement  
Cost: 8 SP  
You possess a Tinker Specialty that allows improving existing Tinker Tech. This can improve the foundation and material of something without replacing the device in question, allowing it to inherit any unique properties such as Enhancement charges. You can greatly improve the power and flexibility of Tinker Devices.

(Tinker) Geneticist  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can alter the genome of living beings to add or remove traits. Building upon genes to give altercations to the body for various abilities. This can range from poisonous blood to night vision. You can work with the DNA of other species to add to a different one.  
Wet-Tinker  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required: Blasto, or (Tinker) Geneticist  
You are a wet-works specialist. You have the talent to create anything from advanced medicines to bio-implants to clones to super soldiers and even new species.

(Tinker) E=MC²  
Cost: 8 SP  
You specialize in creating Tinker Tech that transforms Energy into Mass and vice versa. You can create highly condensed energy batteries that can construct and deconstruct blueprints on the fly. This Tinker Specialty is heavily Energy-dependent, but so long as it has Energy it can constantly repair and reconstruct itself. This Tinker Specialty pairs well with other Tinker powers, but especially (Tinker) Energy.

(Tinker) Crystals\!  
Cost: 8 SP  
You are a tinker specializing in all things crystals. A few examples of what you can accomplish are things like crystal supercomputer cores, and crystal lenses that make making laser weapons easy. Beyond various kinds of technology you can also make crystals that have special properties like among other things, elemental crystals that can be used to manipulate classical fantasy elements with the proper setup.

[(Tinker) Absurdity](#bookmark=id.strhb26k33x6)

(Tinker) Bio-Mimicry  
Cost: 8 SP  
You have the ability to build intricate machines that emulate the features of living beings. They are just as effective, if not more so, than their biological counterparts and can be programmed with semi-advanced AI to perform tasks with precision and accuracy. For instance, you can construct a device that camouflages the wearer, mimicking the properties of a chameleon, allowing them to disappear from sight.

(Tinker) Bonsai  
Cost: 7 SP  
You have a tinker specialisation in the creation and manipulation of “technological seeds”. These seeds do nothing initially, but they will mutate over time to become various pieces of technology, gaining random modifiers to its existing functions or even entirely new features (their very first mutation will always be gaining some kind of feature, which will influence the chances of all future mutations).  
Your tinker specialisation gives you the tools to manipulate the growth of your seeds, including speeding up the rate of mutation; encouraging and discouraging them to/from certain types of mutations; and pruning away any unwanted mutations that have occurred (although you cannot choose to keep only part of a mutation, so if a mutation manifested as a positive & a negative, you would be removing the positive alongside the negative if you chose to remove it).  
With sufficient time, resources, and the right string of mutations, you could hypothetically grow tinkertech from any tinkers tech tree as effective as the tinkers themselves.  
This synergizes well with other tinker powers, as they will give you the ability to heavily influence the mutations in the direction of your other specialisations, allowing you to produce tech for those trees cheaper than building them directly, although at the cost of potentially having to spend a long time pruning mutations in order to get the fine details you may desire.

(Tinker) Robots  
Cost: 8 SP  
You are a Tinker specializing in robotics. Unless you put in a significant amount of work, your robots won't have more than a simple AI (relative to something like Dragon), but they're perfectly capable in the role they were designed for. You are capable of programming your robots to function autonomously for some time.  
FaeR: Automata  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Robots  
Your power to create robots has extended the reach of its database into a similar field of study, that being androids, automata, and other such machines that are human in appearance. The appearance of these androids (unless designed otherwise) will be able to fool even the most astute or observant of people into believing that they’re human, with only Thinkers, other Tinkers, and metal detectors being able to infer or uncover the truth.  
This upgrade synergizes well with many Tinker powers.  
*Machine Hearts*  
Required:(Tinker) Code  
Along with this, your limit in regard to how advanced you can make your AIs has been loosened. Now, with your Code specialization, you are able to make your creations with full sentience, up to the level of Dragon if you truly want them to. You could also simply make advanced AI that are so close to sentience, that they fool almost everyone into believing that they’re human.

(Tinker) Huge Scale  
Cost: 7 SP  
You specialize in designing and creating massive machines that can withstand harsh conditions. Your Tinker Tech can be easily scaled upwards and solve the difficulties of making your projects much larger. You can create all kinds of colossal structures from giant mechas to floating fortresses, large factories, and so on.  
Heavy Metal  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Huge Scale  
Not only can you build massive, robust structures with ease, but you can also now apply those same principles to smaller-scale designs. By choosing to scale down your technology, you can retain its durability, power, and resilience, while also streamlining its production. The catch? Anything you choose to miniaturize will be extremely dense and weighty. This added mass comes with substantial benefits: the heavier the tech, the stronger it becomes and the more straightforward it is for you to create. Compact mechas, heavy-duty armor, dense drones, and powerful hand-held devices are all within your grasp, each with the durability and toughness of their larger counterparts. Do be warned that most of your heavy tech might be unusable for many, even a simple handgun will weigh as much as an average adult male.

(Tinker) Mechanics  
Cost: 7 SP  
You have the skills of a master mechanic. You can design and make effectively any mechanical device, from precision timepieces to clockwork soldiers to pneumatic rifles to hydraulic battering rams. Anything that relies on purely mechanical power, you can build.  
This power works best when paired with other Tinker powers.

(Tinker) Gravity  
Cost: 7 SP  
You specialize in tech involving various forms of gravity and weight. You can create devices that are heavier or lighter than they should be, beams that change the gravity of whoever is hit, and fly.

(Tinker) Nautical  
Cost: 7 SP  
You have a Tinker Specialty working with Water. You can create all kinds of hydrokinetic machines and devices powered by water. Or even anti-water machines. This can range from containers that store more liquids than it normally can to devices that repel all water in a large radius. This can even trump Leviathan's control over water.

(Tinker) Aero  
Cost: 7 SP  
You possess a Tinker Specialty working with various kinds of gases and air. You can create air cannons, air-based jetpacks, windmills, and other things that utilize air. This includes gas-based chemical weapons and other things that spread through the air.

(Tinker) Thermal  
Cost: 7 SP  
You possess a Tinker Specialty that works with and controls thermal energy. You can create devices that can flash freeze entire areas, flamethrowers that set even concrete on fire, and jetpacks. Essentially you can create anything that involves the increase or decrease of various temperatures or anything that involves generating heat or cold.

(Tinker) Armor  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can create advanced armor of various kinds. A set of power armor made by you might be able to shrug off a hit from an Endbringer.

(Tinker) Style  
Cost: 7 SP  
When it comes to tinkering, it's not all about functionality \- aesthetics can play a critical role in the effectiveness of your devices. With your power, you can improve the performance of your tinkertech by making it more visually appealing. This pairs well with other tinker powers.  
Sets  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Style  
When gears you make share a similar theme, combining them activates a set effect, enhancing their performance. The effectiveness increases the more items there are in the set, however in exchange the set effect can only activate when all the set gear are used.  
This effect varies based on the theme of the set, offering tailored boosts for different gear combinations. For example, a Steampunk-themed set grants the power to be immune to and shoot out high pressure steam. Another example is a Nature-themed set granting regeneration abilities as well as the ability to communicate with plants.

(Tinker) Chemistry  
Cost: 6 SP  
You are a wizard in the lab. You have the skills to create new materials, from super-alloys to acids to explosives to superconductors and beyond.  
This power works best when paired with other Tinker powers.

(Tinker) Manton Limits  
Cost: 6 SP  
You can create Tinker Tech that has Manton Limits. Preventing powers from directly influencing your Tinker Tech. With greater research into your specialty, you can even create things that block out powerful technopathy, anti-machine powers or devices.

(Tinker) Imprisonment  
Cost: 6 SP  
You are a tinker specialized in detainment, compliance, and, most of all, punishment. Capable of creating “housing” structures that caged any type of prisoner, elaborate tailor-made cells for a particular type of parahuman or paranatural entity, you also fashion any paraphernalia or bondage to keep anyone compliant or simply docile enough to obey orders or assignments. Suppose this compliance isn’t sufficient for the poor schmuck. In that case, you can build any device, contingency, or feature in your project to dish out a penalty or punishment against disobedience or rebellion.  
Amidst all the unpleasant implications, it mostly depends on how you apply this specialty, for all that it entails.

(Tinker) Electronics  
Cost: 6 SP  
A techie's best friend, your skills with electronics are unparalleled. With the right materials you could make a supercomputer the size of a smartphone.  
This power works best when paired with other Tinker powers, especially Mechanics.

(Tinker) Guns  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can create advanced guns, though nothing that can't be transported on a non-brute person. If you have a Sniper Rifle you made enough time to charge, say about 10 minutes, you could probably damage an Endbringer's core. Unfortunately, that means you'd have to charge your Sniper Rifle before the Endbringer battle and you'd only have one shot. You'd also have to know where the core was, and the Endbringer might be able to dodge it even if you aimed correctly.

(Tinker) Emotions  
Cost: 6 SP  
You create technology that interacts with emotions. This can manifest in two different ways. The first is technology that detects and manipulates emotions. The second is technology that is powered by emotions. For the latter, the type of emotions used to power the device can affect its effectiveness. An offensive weapon may be better powered by negative emotions while a healing device may be better powered by positive emotions. Artificial Emotions gained from direct power use or tinkertech have a reduced or zero effect when powering your devices. Indirect methods such as illusions don't have such restrictions.

(Tinker) Software  
Cost: 6 SP  
Your expertise lies in the realm of software and programming. You possess unparalleled skills in designing and developing complex software systems, hacking tools, and programs. With the right materials, you can create powerful software applications that can analyze vast amounts of data, infiltrate secure networks, or control robotic systems. Your creations can range from sophisticated cybersecurity algorithms, artificial data generation, and advanced virtual reality simulations. This power synergizes well with other Tinker abilities, allowing you to integrate software seamlessly into Tinkertech.

(Tinker) Quantum Computing  
Cost: 6 SP  
You specialize in quantum computers and other forms of highly advanced calculations. You can create Tinker Tech that can simulate the past and future and connect the dots to create detailed informative guesses. The better and more accurate information you feed into them, the better you can simulate various kinds of things. This pairs especially well with (Tinker) Software and (Tinker) Code.

(Tinker/Thinker) Encryption  
Cost: 6 SP  
With this power, you possess the remarkable ability to safeguard information, unravel cyphers, and more, while also granting you the capacity to black box any device, rendering it impervious to reverse engineering and preserving its inner workings as an impenetrable enigma to others.

(Tinker) Illusion  
Cost: 6 SP  
You specialize in Illusion-based technology, where you excel at utilizing holograms, sound systems, and even manipulating the senses to create a vast array of illusions. Your abilities allow you to craft incredibly convincing and immersive displays that can have a profound impact on your audience. Whether through sound, visuals, or a combination of both, your illusions are sure to leave a lasting impression on those who witness them.

(Tinker) Camouflage  
Cost: 6 SP  
You can disguise your Tinker Tech in a wide variety of ways that obscure itself to various forms of detection. It can pretend to be something harmless when it's actually something dangerous. Even when disassembled it can not only still work, it can fool other Tinkers and Thinkers.

(Tinker) Counter-Tech  
Cost: 6 SP  
You are a tinker that specializes in countering other tinkers. You can create devices that locate and modify tinkertech, disguise as other tinkertech, and even bypass tinkertech safeguards. You also gain a minor specialization which changes to be the optimal counter to any tinker specialization of your choosing. It takes an hour to change your minor specialization.  
Utility Belt  
Cost: 9 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Counter-Tech  
You are adept at identifying and exploiting the weaknesses of all capes. You can dissect their powers and vulnerabilities with pinpoint accuracy. You gather data on a cape’s power, combat style, psychological profile, and any known or hidden weaknesses. Once you have identified a cape's weaknesses, you can design and fabricate technology specifically tailored to neutralize or counteract them.

Whether it's a device that disrupts telepathic signals, armor that absorbs and redirects kinetic energy, or gadgets that exploit a superhuman's specific physiological vulnerabilities, your creations are unrivaled in their precision and effectiveness. Your technology ranges from simple, single-use items to complex, multi-functional systems, all designed with the singular purpose of neutralizing a specific target. For instance, if a cape has a deep-seated fear or trauma, you can develop a device that triggers illusions or sounds related to that fear, causing them to hesitate or lose control in battle. Or, if a cape is vulnerable to electricity, you can generate an electromagnetic field in their vicinity, saturating the area with high levels of electricity, disrupting their powers.  
In addition to your technical prowess, your power also helps you to deploy these devices in the most opportune moments, ensuring maximum impact. You are not just a creator but a tactician, using your inventions to outmaneuver and outsmart even the most formidable foes.

(Tinker) Add-On Augmentation  
Cost: 6 SP  
Your Tinker power allows you to create specialized add-ons and enhancements for existing Tinkertech devices, seamlessly integrating them to optimise functionality, push the boundaries of technology, and become a valuable asset in any tinker collaboration by expanding the group's technological arsenal.

(Tinker) Redundancy  
Cost: 6 SP  
With your Tinker power, you excel at creating fault-tolerant Tinkertech devices that can withstand extensive damage or component loss, ensuring they continue to operate optimally in the face of adversity. Through innovative design principles and meticulous engineering, your inventions demonstrate remarkable durability, adaptability, and reliability, making them highly resistant to failures and providing a significant advantage in critical missions and challenging environments.

(Tinker) Traps  
Cost: 6 SP  
You have a Tinker specialization focused on traps, with the ability to create complex and destructive devices with anomalous effects, such as landmines that erase everything within its radius, or simple objects made to surprise people. You also have a minor specialization in hiding your creations in plain sight and a minor Thinker power focused on strategic positioning. These powers enable you to strategically place your traps, keeping adversaries off balance and increasing your chances of success in battles.

(Tinker) Hyperspecialized  
Cost: 6 SP  
You have the power to improve one aspect of tinkertech, whether it be the durability, functionality, or utility, to an incredible degree, but this will come at a price, with every other aspect of the piece degrading to almost unusable levels. With this power, you can create hyper-specialized technology, able to do one thing to a level of mastery, but falling short when trying to perform any other function. Whether it's building a machine that can lift a hundred tons but breaks at a gust of wind, or building a computer that can process a million times more data per second than the current supercomputers but has no memory to store the data, you have the ability to create machines that can exceed anything ever created before, with one caveat: they have to excel at only one thing at the cost of failing at everything else.

(Tinker) Clockwork Precision  
Cost: 5 SP  
Your Tinker specialisation lies in Synchronicity: technology that works best when used/activated in concert with the occurrence of a predefined event. i.e a shield that blocks attacks better if you’ve just provoked your attacker to speak; a set of mortars that work best when fired in sync or canon with each other to increase the spread of the destruction or maximise damage to the bombarded area; a crossbow that pierces through solid slabs of concrete when it's knocked and fired to an inbuilt beat, but is little better than a BB gun if operated too far off beat.  
The efficacy of the tinkertech inversely scales to the controllability and commonality of the event it's synchronised to; becoming better the harder it is to time the use of the tinkertech to the event it's built for.  
On its own this Tinker specialisation doesn't work well with electricity, instead being clockwork themed.

(Tinker) Memory Fabrication  
Cost: 5 SP  
Your Tinker power enables you to manipulate and fabricate memories. You can create devices that alter or implant memories in individuals, allowing for memory modification, erasure, or fabrication. These inventions can have profound implications in fields such as therapy, intelligence gathering, or even manipulation of adversaries.

(Tinker) Shields  
Cost: 5 SP  
You have the ability to create shields, whether they are mobile, fixed, or personal. These shields can vary from those inspired by ancient civilizations (Romans, Greeks, etc.) to advanced forcefields or skin tight variants. When connected to a potent energy source, they might even have the potential to withstand an attack from an Endbringer.

[(Tinker) Sound/Vibration](#bookmark=id.adwrm87of3v2)

(Tinker) Virtual Reality  
Cost: 5 SP  
Your tinker specialty lies in the realm of virtual reality. Your tinker specialty lies in both the hardware and the software components of VR and AR, allowing you to create seamless virtual words that feel no different from reality. You will be able to create lifelike AI to populate your virtual creations, however true AI will be out of your reach for a long time.

(Tinker) Speed  
Cost: 5 SP  
You specialize in tech involving speed and mobility. You can create jetpacks, suits that give the wearer super speed, and are generally capable of making things move faster.

(Tinker) Weaving  
Cost: 5 SP  
You possess a Tinker Specialty that creates and incorporates Tinker Tech into various forms of silk or silk-like materials. You can create anything related to clothing, such as color-changing cloaks, self-regenerating weaves, sticky webs, and so on. This power works best when paired with other Tinker powers, as you can convert and compress them into clothing.

(Tinker) Swords  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can create sci-fi swords, halberds, spears, and other melee weapons. A sword made by you might be able to truly damage an Endbringer. If used by a Brute, it might even kill one... with a lucky hit.

(Tinker) Lorax  
Cost: 5 SP  
You are a tinker that specializes in trees and their produce, you can make faster-growing acres, fire-proof paper armor, explosive charcoals, healing maple-syrup, wood shields harder than iron and many more\!  
*Tinker of Nature*  
Required:(Master/Tinker) Master of Green  
Before, your ability to tinker was limited to just trees and their produce. Now your tinker specialisation has expanded to enable you to work similarly with any and all plant life along with their produce. You can make superconductive plant roots to channel electricity, bamboo and plant fibres tougher than steel, self-healing smart natural rubber, berries filled with meals worth of nutrients, toxin-filtering respirators using moss and so much more.

(Tinker) Attunement  
Cost: 4 SP  
You are a focal tinker. That means you focus on a single item, refining and rebuilding said item with multiple or a singular powerful function(s). This means that you do extremely well with a single weapon or outfit that you focus on and improve, however it also means that you will be extra vulnerable to having your gear taken or destroyed. This doesn't mean its impossible to make multiple objects, just that they will be nowhere near the quality of whichever item you focus on the most.

(Tinker) Ruggedization  
Cost: 4 SP  
You possess the ability to bolster base materials, rendering them resistant to corrosion, insulating against extreme temperatures, and impervious to the elements. This power allows you to manipulate the very structure of materials and technology, enhancing their durability. With it, you can fortify structures and enable them to withstand even the harshest environments.  
Salvage  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Ruggedization  
You specialize in material gathering and processing, extending your expertise to encompass the creation of various industrial plants. This includes the development of processing plants, recycling facilities, refining structures, and more.  
This pair well with any autonomous Tinker powers  
Immortal Tinker Methodology  
Cost: 9 SP  
Required:(Tinker) Ruggedization  
You now have the ability to beef up your technology to unprecedented levels, such as ensuring it operates in perfect condition for centuries without the need for inspection, even less maintenance.  
You can direct these enhancements in a specific way without degrading the technology's base function. For instance, a cryo-gun could be enhanced to withstand the conditions at the center of a pulsar, though its resistance to cold remains unchanged. Similarly, a clock could be enhanced to display accurate time even within a black hole, though it wouldn’t be able to resist gravity inside the black hole while making everything better would make the clock work on the mantle of the earth or buried on the bottom of the ocean.  
As an added benefit, you can choose not to enhance your tech in any specific way and instead make it immune to all-or-nothing effects. This means you could create objects capable of countering the Siberian, canceling the effects of Sting, or truly affecting Alexandria, though it still falls on the technology itself to stop the object once the effect of the power is cancelled, so a fragile shield can still be broken, even if it's All-or-Nothing attribute is cancelled. This immunity can prevent complete nullification or destruction of your tech by such effects.  
Additionally, the “Only Sith Deal in Absolutes” Perk can make all your tech have this effect without any cost.

(Tinker) Ergonomics  
Cost: 4 SP  
You specialize in making equipment that works with or enhances what a user is already capable of doing. Ranging from making a taser gun powered by the user's electricity powers to lung augmentations that significantly improve the user's ability to hold their breath. This synergizes with the powers you have, making them better and easier to control with your Tinker Tech. A user will be able to maintain and use Tinker Tech built for them with proper training or manuals.

(Tinker/Thinker) Garment  
Cost: 3 SP  
The user is able to gain a deep understanding of fashion, clothing, and design, as well as the emotions and ideas that can be expressed through them. They are able to design and create clothing and other garments that reflect and amplify their emotions and personality, and to read and understand the intentions and emotions behind the clothing and uniforms worn by others.

(Tinker/Master) Love Potion  
Cost: 4 SP  
You can make potions/chemicals that have a number of weak effects. They can be poisonous, heal small wounds, increase natural regeneration by 100%, act as steroids without the downsides, cause emotions that can be suppressed if the person who drinks the potion has sufficient willpower, or increase senses by a significant margin. You can also make any mundane chemical with ease. Your potions can do a number of other things, but they're all fairly weak.  
Aerosolised  
Cost: 2 SP  
Required:(Tinker/Master) Love Potion  
You are able to transform your concoctions into aerosolized gases, enabling their effects to be delivered through the air.  
You can control the concentration and spread of the gas, tailoring its reach and impact to suit your needs. From precise, localised dispersal to wide-area effects, the flexibility in deployment significantly enhances the tactical value of your work.  
The aerosolized form retains all the original properties of your potions but does not exceed their inherent strength. At best, the gases are only as potent as the potions you can already create, meaning you cannot amplify their effects beyond your existing capabilities.  
Lastly, you also gain the ability to make gadgets designed to contain and release these gases effectively. These devices are tailored to your needs and include items such as pressurised canisters, timed-release capsules, smoke grenades, and environmental diffusion systems.

(Tinker) Communication  
Cost: 3 SP  
You can create things that can transfer large amounts of data from one place to another extremely quickly or even instantaneously.

(Tinker) Repair  
Cost: 3 SP  
You can repair, maintain, and use any Tinkertech you find. You can also combine Tinkertech into something that combines the functions of the two inventions. Any Tinkertech you repair or maintain will, in the future, last longer.

(Tinker) Self-Repair  
Cost: 3 SP  
You excel at creating advanced technology that both repairs and maintains itself. Like for example a sword that self sharpens getting rid of nicks acquired in combat, or power armor that repairs cracks in its frame.  
This comes paired with a minor generalized tinker tech tree slightly beyond the innate knowledge most tinkers have on technology not related to their specialty.

(Tinker) Detection and Analysis  
Cost: 3 SP  
You can create things that detect, find, or analyze other things.

#### Master 

(Master) Khepri  
Cost: 15 SP  
You have absolute control of the bodies and powers of every carbon based lifeform within 10 meters of yourself, as well as an unlimited ability to multitask. This power extends through portals. You will retain your sanity. You can turn this power off at will, or let people within your range keep control of themselves while you control others. Certain people are immune to this power, such as Alexandria and Imp.

[(Master) Shadow Servant](#bookmark=id.73ncua3afdb)

(Master/Trump) Open Eyes  
Cost: 12 SP  
You can cause anyone who sees you or your power manifestations to suffer memetic hazards, inducing mental damage to anyone who perceives you with any of their senses. While this power is active, individuals who observe you will begin to suffer psychological and physical damage, ranging from nausea to headaches. The severity of these symptoms escalates with prolonged exposure, leading to complete madness and causing them to attack everyone around them after a few minutes. This effect extends to any medium that depicts you while the power is active, such as photographs or drawings. You are also a complete blindspot to all Thinker powers short of those that are like Contessa.

[(Master/Thinker) Truth Serum](#bookmark=id.gdfxphyzrbt6)

(Shaker/Master) Depression  
Cost: 10 SP  
You have an aura of total apathy and despair. It causes people to simply stop what they were doing and stare into space, remembering the worst parts of themselves and how meaningless their actions are. The effects last for as long as the victims are in your range, which is about 50 meters in radius.

(Master/Shaker) Logosthesia  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can emit a gas around your body. When inhaled, this gas breaks down specific neurological connections in the brain, leading to a complete collapse of the individual's established worldview. While their memories remain intact, their beliefs and interpretations of the world are entirely reset.  
For example, if a doctor were exposed to the gas, they would still retain memories of their medical practice and skills, but might now believe in absurd notions, such as a banana being capable of curing a stab wound, similar to what a naive child might believe.  
Immediately after exposure to the gas, individuals become highly susceptible to influence by the first narrative presented to them. For instance, a deeply religious person might become an atheist or adopt Mickey Mouse as their new deity. Similarly, a prejudiced individual could transform into an exceptionally open-minded person, and vice versa.  
Upon receiving a replacement narrative, they unquestioningly accept everything presented to them. Alternatively, if left to their own devices, they may embrace any fanciful notions their mind might come up with.

(Master/Thinker) Brain Drain  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can temporarily siphon 25% of the mental capabilities of everyone within 25 meters of you. The combined intelligence, processing ability, multitasking, etc that you siphon lasts for 25 minutes after they leave your range, though your victims regain their full faculties immediately.

(Master/Tinker) Kerbal  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can summon little green men that stand 0.75 meters tall and possess an innate understanding of mundane technology. They can easily design cutting-edge technology that is fully replicable.  
These little green men can operate on your behalf, either working individually or collaborating together to tackle large tasks, creating a versatile and effective workforce that can produce results efficiently and with high precision.   
While they are initially proficient in a wide range of technologies, they will gradually gain specialized areas of expertise as they become more experienced, allowing them to create pseudo-tinkertech. However, they will be inferior compared to tinkers with the same specialty, only beating them in their understanding of their technology.

[(Master) Detached Shadow](#bookmark=id.73ncua3afdb)

(Master) Technopathy  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can control any electronic within 200 meters of yourself and become a genius when it comes to coding. You can hack into electronics farther than 200 meters from you as long as you're using an electronic within 200 meters of you to do it.

[(Master/Thinker) Sandman](#bookmark=id.79pvi4okogti)

(Master/Brute) Emotivore  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can sense and consume emotions, drawing them from others as if they were a tangible energy source. It is easier and more effective for you to sense and eat emotions directed at you. When you feed on emotions, they nourish and empower you, granting a temporary surge of strength and vitality. Draining people of their emotions leave them lethargic and apathetic. This state is temporary but draining all of their emotions multiple times extends the duration of this state until it becomes permanent.  
Note that indulging in too many emotions at once carries risks. Overconsumption leads to a volatile reaction within you, resulting in you vomiting, releasing pure, liquid emotion. This liquid, a concentrated essence of whatever feeling you consumed, is potent and potentially dangerous. If another person were to ingest this emotional substance, they would experience an overwhelming burst of that specific emotion, magnified to an extreme.  
For example, if you had gorged on hatred, drinking this liquid would fill the person with an uncontrollable surge of hatred, likely consuming their thoughts and behaviour.

(Master) Lifestyle Changer  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can give yourself or others an increasing amount of dread the more an action is performed repeatedly. The longer they repeat the action, the more they will dislike it. This can be subtle in as many as 4000 repeats needed to hate it or as few as 10 repeats needed.

(Master/Striker) Forget It  
Cost: 7 SP  
With just a touch and a word, you can make anyone forget everything and anything related to that word as well as the word itself. This can range from names to objects, or even general knowledge. They will totally forget everything about it, even the definition of it.

(Master) Red Strings  
Cost: 7 SP  
With repeated exposure, you can make people think of others in certain ways. This power only activates when you, the person you're affecting, and the person you want to change what they think about are in the presence of each other.

[(Master) Heart Demon](#bookmark=id.46buk9jbfvrj)

(Master) In Your Shadow  
Cost: 6 SP  
When you defeat someone, you can inspire them to follow you. As long as you are strong enough to defeat them they will remain loyal to you. You can make them genuinely loyal to you during this time.

(Master/Brute) Anger Issues  
Cost: 6 SP  
You gain the ability to sense and project anger and rage from those within a few blocks of you. The emotional reaction is dependent on the person affected but is also subtle and slow enough that unless they are already aware of you, your power would seem natural. You also gain an increase in general durability and strength proportional to the anger of those around you.

(Master/Brute) Come at Me Bro\!  
Cost: 6 SP  
You have the ability to taunt any enemies in a 100 meter radius, pulling their attention towards you while making them ignore any attacks from others, up to a certain point. This also gives you a slight brute rating.

(Master) Ditto  
Cost: 6 SP  
You can duplicate everybody that you can currently see and yourself. Duplicates spawn directly behind the original, facing in the opposite direction. Everybody duplicated by your power controls both their original body and the cloned body; however, because you can’t give secondary multitasking power to anybody they clone, the overall effect is highly disorienting rather than empowering. Duplicates are ‘fragile'—if they’re knocked unconscious, even for just a moment, they vanish.

(Master/Thinker) Instinct  
Cost: 6 SP  
You can cause a target to have a "gut" feeling about a particular subject. You can influence what this gut feeling will be, but you can't completely control it.

(Master) Confession  
Cost: 5 SP  
When this power is activated this forces whoever you ask a question to answer truthfully. This works off the spirit of the question, your power automatically communicating your intentions even when you would fail. This can be directed as you wish, only affecting those you wish to affect and no one else.

(Master) Monologue  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can cause other people around you to monologue for long periods of time without them realizing it. This can cause them to reveal all forms of information they otherwise wouldn't normally say.

(Master/Stranger) Reversed Controls  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can reverse how anyone within your line of sight perceives direction. They will see up as down, left as right, and forwards as backward. This effect wears off as soon as they are out of your line of sight.

[(Master/Thinker) Fear](#bookmark=id.79pvi4okogti)  
(Master) Recite  
Cost: 3 SP  
You can force anyone to say anything. There is no limit to what you can make them say or what words they can speak. You can even make them speak languages they don’t know.

(Master) Uncanny Valley  
Cost: 2 SP  
When you activate this power, your micro expressions shift, triggering an instinctual feeling in others that something isn't quite right. It will cause others who interact with you to feel that something is off, slowly growing fearful from the "eerie" feeling they get from you. This effect grows to the point they will get fearful at the mere thought of you, although it weakens as they spend less time with you.

(Master) State the obvious  
Cost: 2 SP  
Every participant in discussions you participate in will understand the rationality and viewpoint of all the other sides. Information gained from this power cannot harm you in any way, and you may toggle this ability at will.

#### Breaker

(Breaker) Reconstruction  
Cost: 14 SP  
Whenever you enter a Breaker state, you fully, and painlessly, heal. This also removes the effects of Masters and Strangers. You can enter a glowing Breaker state where you emit blinding amounts of light, which you can target.  
Things you target with your light for over 30 seconds will begin to be repaired, including humans.  
Your reaction time is 5x faster.

[(Breaker/Shaker) Bugged Out](#bookmark=id.iz572j6kfm4k)

[(Breaker) Rebirth](#bookmark=id.bh760jocoq7a)

(Breaker/Trump) Elemental Boost  
Cost: 8 SP  
Taking elemental damage allows you to absorb it. Electrical damage makes you faster and stronger than you normally would be and rubble would make you more durable. The greater the damage a normal human would take would dictate how long you would be boosted. If you possess an elemental power, you can have it as long as you want. If you currently possess an element like Thunder, you cannot absorb non-thunder elements like Fire until the duration of Thunder is over.

(Breaker/Mover) Puella Magi Homura Magika  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can send yourself back in time by up to 5 minutes, replacing your past self but with all your future self's injuries and possessions, but you won't be able to use the ability again until you're back to when you time traveled from.

(Breaker) Superposition  
Cost: 6 SP  
You have the ability to perform multiple actions simultaneously on a quantum level. You are limited to 10 actions at the same time and all of them must be locked in the same single point of space you are standing in.

#### Brute

(Brute) Mine, Mine, Mine\!  
Cost: 12 SP  
You have the combined strength, speed, and durability of everyone within ten meters of you. Good against Brutes, not so much against Blasters.

(Brute) Ablation  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can only take so much damage at a time, regardless of how much damage you should be taking. The severity of damage is also reduced to a set amount. A single attack will gouge out a teaspoon of your flesh at most. Beams are not considered a single attack.  
Gavel  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your power makes it so you can only take so much damage at a time, and reduces the severity of any damage to a set amount. Shooting you with a hail of bullets would be little different from shooting you with one or two bullets, and any given bullet would only gouge out a teaspoon's worth of flesh. Offensively, you have the ability to lift objects three to four times your own weight, and to imbue melee weapons with both your durability and with vast impact. You can also transfer your defensive power from your weapon to your target, making the target near-invulnerable as it flies through the air. The target will then be pulverized when it hits something else.

(Brute) Caeneus  
Cost: 7 SP  
You are UNBREAKABLE\!\!\!, or at least your skin is, for the most part. Your skin now has a slight All or Nothing effect to it. This prevents it from being torn apart by other All or Nothing powers without significant force behind it to pierce through your protection, with your only other notable weakness being that it is only just skin deep, meaning you will still have to deal with pain, blunt force trauma, heat, radiation, etc. Things that can affect your gooey interior are fair game.  
In combination with this, you have been given a substantial all-around boost in all your other physical aspects, from looks, healing, strength, etc. Providing superhuman amplifications, though not enough to take down a whole squad of professional soldiers on your own. When coming into contact with seawater, you gain an accelerated healing factor.

*Kishin*  
Required:Changer/Brute (Skin)  
Your ability to control your skin has allowed you to weaponize your unbreakable skin. By manipulating your skin’s texture and density, you can alter your skin into makeshift weapons still possessing your All or Nothing effect. Examples include turning your hand into claws, your feet into hammers, and creating “spikes” along your back.  
Your added control over your All or Nothing effect has given you the ability to selectively enhance certain parts of your skin to the detriment of others.  
The enhanced health of your skin has also become enhanced health for you in general, giving a minor boost to your healing factor both in and out of seawater.

*60% of The Time, It Works Every Time*  
Required:(Trump) Error, Try Again  
Your skin now disrupts all powers trying to affect it, be it Thinker, Master, Stranger, etc. Now, powers need to pass a 60% skill check before they can affect you, requiring 5 minutes in between before each try. You also gain a notable increase in your All or Nothing effect, such that even if something were to have penetrated your defenses, it still needs to pass a 60% skill check before it could.

(Brute) Pridwen  
Cost: 7 SP  
If you are aware of an attack, it will not harm you. You can only be hurt by sneak attacks. If you're hit by an attack that's too quick for your mind to comprehend that it's there, you are not considered aware of it by your power.

[(Brute) Zombie](#bookmark=id.46l8gpsatez5)

(Brute/Trump) No Pain, No Gain  
Cost: 6 SP  
The more injured you are, the more powerful you become. You become stronger, faster, more durable, and react faster. This applies to your powers as well. You also possess a mild Brute power that keeps you standing even after your bones are broken. If you are on your last-minute stand, you could find yourself contesting an Endbringer in physical might with just an ordinary person's strength.  
*Pain not Wasted*  
Required:(Brute) Biological Redistribution  
When your heart is destroyed, you become insanely strong, but that strength disappears when it's healed. Not anymore, not while you're still in the fight. When you obtain your boosts from your injuries, it won't disappear outright if they are healed, instead sticking with you throughout the whole fight.

(Brute) Fatal Shield  
Cost: 6 SP  
You have a protective aura that negates a single fatal attack regardless of what it was. This can only be used once per 30 seconds, and after usage, you will be immune to any and all forms of attacks, effects, and so on for 10 seconds.

(Brute) Immunity Frames  
Cost: 3 SP  
After taking damage, you cannot take damage from another attack of the same type until a second has passed.

[(Brute) No, I am Spartacus](#bookmark=id.r1t0fwmr6yze)

[(Brute) No, I am Leonidas](#bookmark=id.r1t0fwmr6yze)

(Brute) Lifesteal  
Cost: 2 SP  
When you hurt someone in some way, be it through punching, stabbing, or shooting, you will be healed for the equivalent to the damage you caused. If you were to dismember someone, that would count as completely destroying their arm, allowing you to regenerate the equivalent of an entire arm.

#### Shaker

(Shaker/Striker) Holonomic Constraint  
Cost: 15 SP  
With a touch, you can lock the spatial position of an object relative to another object you have recently touched. You may choose a surface or curve of allowed relative positions, such as a sphere of constant distance or a straight line which prevents orthogonal movement. This effect is inherently symmetric and forces are shared between the two bodies as if joined by an unbreakable physical link. You may choose whether the constraint is tied to the orientation of either or both bodies. Applications include: linking an opponent to a speeding vehicle to carry them along at high speed, "levitating" an object by constraining its vertical position relative to the floor, or steering a projectile in mid-air by constraining it to a radial line oriented with the weapon. The effect ends on its own after about an hour, or if you dismiss it, but is otherwise inviolable.

[(Shaker/Mover) Dimensional Warping](#bookmark=id.s8w46pj4e2m9)

(Shaker) Deus Ex Machina  
Cost: 14 SP  
Things tend to go in your favour. Endbringers won't attack the city you're in, you'll almost always win when you gamble, and you won't get hit by a stray shot. This only affects matters of luck. If someone is trying to kill you, it won't make the roof fall on them unless it was already falling apart. Flechette won't manage to shoot the Endbringer core when it's about to kill you unless she was already aiming near the core. The Slaughterhouse 9 is unlikely to target you unless you're either a perfect target for them or you took the Slaughterhouse 8 drawback.

[(Shaker) Hazardous Disaster](#bookmark=id.xuyixk9x6uv3)

[(Shaker) Storm](#bookmark=id.axwipeh9unv)

(Shaker/Master) Dirt in Your Eye  
Cost: 10 SP  
You possess the ability to implant within a city block the sensation of having dirt put on the subject's eye. Allowing for the distraction of those who wish to harm the user, the sensation does not care about durability bypassing normal defenses, giving the same rough and coarse sensation no matter how durable a target is.  
The longer the sensation persists, the worse it gets for those under the effects of this power.  
*Geneva Wants A Word*  
Required:(Shaker/Master) Spicy Snap  
Instead of dirt, those within a city block that wish you harm will now feel as if they continuously get Carolina Reaper sprayed into their eyes and mouth, an effect comparable to constantly getting pepper-sprayed without being able to close your eyes or hold your breath, only dialed up to eleven. This power can neither cause lasting physical damage nor kill anyone affected, though with sufficient exposure your enemy may wish otherwise.

[(Shaker/Striker) Time Magic\!](#bookmark=id.k5skithfiys7)

(Shaker) Impaler  
Cost: 9 SP  
Within a radius of one kilometer, you can create pikes that emerge from the ground, thrusting upwards to impale enemies. The mere sight of the pikes exerts a psychological impact, inducing intense anxiety or fear in opponents and destabilizing their mental state. The closer and less spikes you create at once, the faster they are formed.  
These manifested pikes persist as tangible obstacles, obstructing movement and reducing the likelihood of evasion as time goes on.  
*Vlad*  
Required:Kaiser  
Your pikes are now composed of silver like reinforced steel, vastly increasing their durability and lethality. Additionally, these pikes can now manifest from any object within your effective range. However, they remain Manton-Limited, preventing them from emerging directly inside the bodies of living beings. Their psychological impact has also grown, now actively weakening those in their presence.

(Shaker) Bedlam  
Cost: 8 SP  
You possess the ability to create fields of instability, where reality becomes unpredictable within limited areas. You can generate up to five active fields at a time, with each field having a maximum width of 10 meters and not extending beyond 100 meters from you. Within these defined spaces, the environment, objects, and individuals may undergo unforeseen transformations and fluctuations due to the inherent instability of reality.

(Shaker) Babel  
Cost: 8 SP  
You have a Shaker ability with a city-wide effect, capable of causing a sudden and severe loss of comprehension among those in its range. Those affected find themselves unable to make sense of the things around them, whether it be the language spoken by others, the written words on a page, or even body language. This power covers every aspect of communication, and it affects everyone in proximity, except for those you choose.

(Shaker/Trump) Judgement  
Cost: 8 SP  
You can read and apply effects based on the intent of others within a 250-foot area around you. Hostile intent against you or someone in your range can feel incapable of violence. Meanwhile, people with the intent of sabotage can find themselves failing with simple instructions.

(Shaker/Master) Stormtrooper Aim  
Cost: 7 SP  
You possess the power to prevent anyone who can perceive you to be unable to directly aim at you. This includes powers or weapons.

(Shaker) Speed Zone  
Cost: 7 SP  
You have the power to control the speed of anything within 15 meters of you. The closer it is to you, the more powerful this effect is. For example, if an object is one foot away from you, you can adjust its speed by any percentage from 10% to 1000%. And at 9 feet it can only go between 90% to 200%. This power is not able to go below 0.001% or faster than 1,000,000% and cannot affect yourself.

(Shaker) Healing Circle  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can exude an aura that heals others in a 10-meter radius around yourself.  
Within this area of effect, vitality is refreshed, pain is relieved, open wounds visibly close, and infections are eliminated. Bones will even set properly given enough time in your aura. The more serious the injury, the more difficult it is, and longer it takes to heal.  
You can, with enough focus, exempt individuals from this effect.

(Shaker) Flare  
Cost: 7 SP  
You can cause any non-static phenomena, including your other powers, to instantly and rapidly flare in both size, power, and intensity. This includes causing a lighter to flare into a flamethrower that can melt steel and breathing with enough force to break bones. You can flare any amount of phenomena at once but any more than 10 and the effect is weakened enough as to be functionally useless. Flares last up to a maximum of ten seconds, after which the phenomena reverts to its original intensity. This does not apply to any byproducts caused by the flare such as fire spreading.

(Shaker) Loot Drop  
Cost: 6 SP  
When you take down an opponent, they drop loot based on their strength. Beating regular people usually gives you basic items like money, tools, or jewellery, depending on their status. Stronger or more skilled individuals might drop better things, like advanced weapons or rare materials. Parahumans drop the best loot, often related to their powers, such as unique gear that can boost your own abilities. If you choose to kill instead of just incapacitating them, the loot increases in quantity or quantity by a single magnitude.  
Repeatedly targeting the same individual within a short time frame results in diminishing returns, as the quantity/quality of the loot decreases.

[(Shaker) Electromagnetic Warping](#bookmark=id.5il3i2obxgo0)

(Shaker/Master) Spicy Snap  
Cost: 5 SP  
You gain the ability to, with a snap of your fingers, induce an overwhelming sensation in everyone within a block radius as if they have consumed the world's spiciest chili.  
This sensation persists for five minutes, and any attempts to alleviate it inadvertently escalate the discomfort to unbearable levels, potentially extending its effects up to 24 hours.

(Shaker) Collateral  
Cost: 5 SP  
You can imbue an All-or-Nothing effect into 1000 feet of your surroundings that makes it completely impossible to alter or effect. It's immune to everything you do to it except for sting. This doesn't affect anything small enough to be held by hand, and things like cars still work. You just can't move it or damage it in ways that don't make sense for a car.

(Shaker/Master) Peace Zone  
Cost: 5 SP  
You are able to create a field with a radius of 50 meters that causes all life forms within it to quickly lose all aggression. It also has a slight compulsion that makes people that are outside of it go away.

(Shaker/Master) Influencer  
Cost: 4 SP  
You can project an aura that causes anyone within 100 feet to feel awe and admiration of you. If they have a reason to feel afraid of you, they will instead be intimidated.

[(Shaker/Stranger) The Mist of London Night](#bookmark=id.icdhlhqj73xb)

(Shaker/Trump) You Can’t Touch The Sky  
Cost: 3 SP  
In a 1-kilometer radius around you nobody can fly.  
This affects not only parahumans but also mundane forms of flight like helicopters, planes, and drones, this even affects tinker-tech based flight.  
This does not affect you.  
You can turn this off at will.  
This power can't affect Endbringers or Scion.

(Shaker) Target Acquired  
Cost: 2 SP  
Anyone within 300 meters of you will glow any color you want. They can even be seen through walls or if they're invisible. All parts of this power are toggleable, and you can lower your range however you want. You can decide if others can see the glow, or if you only want specific people to see it.

#### Mover

(Mover) Stamina  
Cost: 3 SP  
You have limitless physical and mental stamina. With limitless physical and mental stamina, fatigue and exhaustion are mere concepts, freeing you from any physical limitations. You can exert yourself to your utmost potential indefinitely, never feeling worn down or drained. This doesn’t give any other boost.

(Mover) Blink\!  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can teleport to anywhere you can see. If you're a Noctis Cape, you can teleport to anywhere you've seen since getting your powers. You can teleport to other universes with this. You cannot use this power to co-inhabit the same space as another being, you will either teleport inside the being or right outside of it.

(Mover/Breaker) Speed Connect  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can intuitively "connect" with inorganic and organic beings of your choice, allowing you to exchange their current acceleration and velocity at your behest. For instance, you can go abnormally fast by linking yourself to a moving car or plane at the expense of making them immobile. You could abuse this to slow people down by linking them to objects in their rest state. Your mind and body gain the necessary physiology to react and adapt to the changing speeds. However, the longer you attempt to maintain it, the more likely you will suffer from mental and physical damages.  
Note: Trying to attach yourself to photons in an attempt to move at light-speed would only go horribly wrong as your body would be rendered near mass-less, leaving your mind in a vegetative state.

(Mover) Sadako  
Cost: 10 SP  
You gain the ability to enter virtual worlds. The way this works is simple: by touching a screen that has an active video playing on it, you can enter a simulated version of said video. From an outside perspective, you will look like you have entered the screen and can be seen interacting with the video from the screen itself. Inside the simulated world, you can interact with the people and environment as if they were all real, allowing you to alter the "plot" of the video. Certain events, such as timeskips, will not happen in the simulated world.

You will be able to see a floating, nearly invisible screen inside the simulated world, one that only you can see. This screen will show the outside world. You can leave the simulated world by touching this screen. After you leave, the simulated world will slowly return to how it should be.  
This is a localised event, so if you were to enter a streamed video, only your device would be affected and no one else. However, you can sense the other devices connected to that stream and are able to transfer yourself to them. Be warned: if your current device were to be deactivated and lose all signal, you would be trapped in the virtual world. This can be used offensively by trapping your enemies inside the virtual world.  
You are unable to bring anything and/or anyone from the virtual world into the real world unless you have Homecoming, although they will still be restricted to a degree based on your Shard's ranking and energy.  
*Book Worm*  
Required:(Trump/Striker) Fictiportation  
Your ability has evolved twofold. First, alongside entering any virtual world, you can now enter any written world. The more famous the story, the more lifelike everything in there will be. A story only known by one person may not even be accessible to you, while something well known across the world will be no different from the real world to you. To enter these worlds you simply need to touch a book the story is written in, and you are able to exit from any version of this written work as long as it’s in the same earth as the one you entered.  
Secondly, you can now bring things out of these worlds, including living people. The limitations of (Trump/Striker) Fictiportation still apply; the more powerful the item or person is, the more energy it drains from you. The more popular and widely known the item or person is, the easier it is to bring it out to the real world. You can bring out items or people that are depicted as being more powerful than PRT Rating 5 but they will be weakened to match your limit. They're capable of regaining their strength as your power grows.

(Mover/Striker) Asynchronous Spacetime  
Cost: 12 SP  
You can manipulate space or time around you, but you must choose which one to control at any given moment. When you control space, you gain an aura that glows red, and when you control time, it glows blue. However, your range is limited to just a few inches from your skin.

While controlling space, you can manipulate objects and even redirect them in your small range. You can prevent attacks from ever reaching you by warping space itself or even teleporting short distances. When you teleport, you can instantly move to any location you can see within range, even if it's behind you or in a different direction. You can even alter the distance you travel in a single step, making each movement more efficient and extending it for a greater distance.

When controlling time, you can accelerate yourself or decelerate anyone or anything within range. For example, you can move faster than the eye can follow, or slow down the actions of opponents or projectiles. Time manipulation works in a way that you can affect anyone or anything within range for a short duration, even if they manage to escape your immediate reach. However, once your influence fades, their movements return to normal speed.

(Mover/Thinker) I am the Shadow  
Cost: 12 SP  
You can teleport to anywhere on the planet where no one is looking, as long as no one is looking at you. If someone is looking at you through Thinker powers, like Clairvoyant, your power still works. You have an awareness of everywhere on the planet that no one is looking. You can't teleport into contact with another living being either. If you try you'll find yourself a couple nanometers away.

[(Mover/Stranger) Shadow Diver](#bookmark=id.73ncua3afdb)

(Mover) Raven  
Cost: 14 SP  
You can open portals to anywhere your friends are, no matter the distance, no matter the universe. This is the only power that will allow you to return to your home universe completely unassisted. Family you're close to are also considered friends by this power. Your portals have to be within 5 meters of the person you wish to teleport to, and can't be opened inside of them (unless they have any holes in their body big enough for you to enter, in which case you can open your portals inside of those.)

(Mover/Striker) Dimensional Shunter  
Cost: 15 SP  
You are capable of teleporting yourself and/or anything you’re touching to the same place in another known dimension.  
You cannot teleport into an occupied location. You instinctively know if attempting a teleport will take you to a place that is guaranteed to kill you (dangerous/no atmosphere, heavy radiation, into lava, etc.) although you do not know what the danger is.  
You can preview any position you can teleport to with this power, so long as it is in a known dimension.  
A dimension becomes known if you either have been there or viewed it directly through some form of Thinker power.  
You can also blindly teleport to an unknown dimension that is “adjacent” to the current dimension you are in.  
For the purposes of blind teleporting, there are two adjacent dimensions to every dimension for this power, forming a chain that contains every dimension in the multiverse not locked off by the entities (so blind jumping will never land you in Shardspace).  
After blind teleporting, you will be unable to teleport using this power for a minute.

## Keystone Powers

World-Walker  
Cost: 25 SP  
You have the ability to travel through the multiverse at your leisure. You can target any dimension you have already visited easily but accessing a precise destination blindly will require some practice, in the meantime you will jump to semi-random destinations every time. You can teleport to locations you are familiar with in the same dimension or one you have not visited provided you have the coordinates relative to yourself. However, teleporting inter-planetary distances require careful planning to hit your target.  
Additionally, your body changed to accommodate cross-dimensional travel to become a projection of your soul. With time and study, you will be able to alter your appearance at will and even replicate the abilities of other creatures; this does include supernatural abilities like magic, psionics, or cultivation. However, while you are able to cast spells or use psychic techniques, you do not have the knowledge to do so. You can of course learn by yourself, at your own risk, find a mentor to teach you, or pick any of the powers available in this section.  
In time, as you grow in power and familiarity with your abilities, you will be able to open portals between locations and even dimensions, create your own pocket spaces or even fully fledged demi-planes under your control. You can reach the power of Elder Worldwalker in around a decade of study, practice, and regular travel. The more time you dedicate yourself to it, the shorter this time becomes.  
Elder World-Walker  
Cost: 35 SP  
Required:World-Walker  
You have the ability to travel through the multiverse at your leisure. You can target any dimension you have already visited easily, down to the exact destination you have in mind even if you have never visited it before. When you jump to a new dimension, you are able to target your desired destination reliably with only the occasional misfire. You can easily teleport or open portals within the same dimension, even to places you have never visited, with only minimal information. However, extra-system teleportation still requires care due to the large distances involved. You are able to open cross-dimension portals but they require concentration to maintain for longer periods of time.

Additionally, your body changed to accommodate cross-dimensional travel to become a projection of your soul. With time and study, you will be able to alter your appearance at will and even replicate the abilities of other creatures; this does include supernatural abilities like magic, psionics, or cultivation. You have a knack for the basics and are able to cast simple cantrips, use weak telekinesis, and reinforce your body with spiritual energy. While you can build upon this yourself, you will progress much faster if you find a mentor to tech you or pick any of the other powers available in this section.  
*Walls of Paper*

Required:Absolute Summoning  
Required:True Immortality  
The Multiverse trembles in your grasp. With your raw power and understanding of the functions of the multiverse combined, you can transcend its limits. Where once you were limited to a single multiverse, requiring centuries of research and travel to find its fleeting brushes with others, you can now travel multiverses with the same contemptuous ease as you move to singular worlds. Your might and knowledge now truly eclipse the oldest travellers who first left their worlds, and reality itself is splayed out to walk as you please  
Fundamentals  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:World-Walker  
Just as universes sit open to you, so do the methods of universal travel. Under the right conditions, you can manipulate the many methods of travel that appear. Granting devices and spells, stopping others from functioning, and twisting these methods altering them more subtly. Everything is possible with enough precision and practice.  
*Interpretation*  
Required:All Angles  
Your understanding of the thousands of methods of interval travel has given you unique insight into their possibilities. You can alter the presentation of any method of travel with great ease. For example, a purely magical method of travel can instead be altered into highly advanced technology.  
*Caged*  
Required:Planar Births  
You’re many worldwalker’s worst nightmare. You may bind a method of travel to any of your worlds, stopping its user from leaving it by any means. Though they still possess whatever has allowed them to travel, and any other benefit it grants them, and may be powerful in their own right, they are forever trapped within one of your worlds.  
*Abrade*  
Required:Absolute Summoning  
You’ve grown ever more adept in the conception of multiversal travel. Creating and destroying such methods has become of extreme ease to you. You could give it as a natural power to a mundane animal, or remove the slightest capability from the greatest of mages, costing them their travel, and all the benefits this ability has given them. However, a sleighed traveller can rebuild, or devise new methods of interdimensional travel.  
*Material*  
Required:True Immortality  
Your understanding of the way these traversal methods connect to their creator has allowed you to alter how it connects to them. A great mage’s spell of planar travel could be changed to a physical flex giving the same properties. This cannot change the rough level of strength the connected traveler possesses, but it can radically alter their presentation.  
All Angles  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:World-Walker  
You can now travel to more than just different worlds. Even the barriers of time and different timelines are nothing to you. There is no method that can now restrict your traversal. You can mentally leave and explore worlds without actually entering them for reconnaissance purposes and to get a better idea of where you might want to go.  
*Repositioning*  
Required:Planar Births  
You can move entities within your constructed worlds. This includes people, objects, and even locations with enough power, though vastly reduced than would otherwise be needed.  
*Scouting Force*  
Required:Absolute Summoning  
You can create your summons within any world you could travel to. However, because they are cut off from you and the majority of your power, the summons will be weaker, and are more likely to dissipate faster than they usually do.  
*Singularity*  
Required:True Immortality  
Through mastery of your soul, you can create multiple bodies to perform multiple actions at once. These bodies can be on different worlds simultaneously, but are limited by your own multi-tasking ability.  
*Worldchase*  
Required:Fundamentals  
Your unparalleled sight into figures within the space between worlds now allows you to immediately hone in on any interdimensional signature you’ve seen before, allowing you to travel to them directly.  
Planar Births  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:World-Walker  
Your ability to create worlds is now improved. No longer will your worlds be skewed to your own axis of power. You are also no longer limited in the size of the worlds you can create, and have no true limits on the kinds of limits you can enforce on the types of rules that reality will have. The only true requirements are understanding and power. You have the ability to fuse two worlds together, creating a new world with characteristics of both. This can be useful for creating new worlds with unique rules, combining the strengths of different worlds, or even merging worlds in order to prevent destruction. You also have complete awareness of anything in the world you have created.  
*Fool's Opus*  
Required:All Angles  
You can transport beings from other universes into and out of your worlds without subjecting them to the corrosive qualities the space between worlds usually hold for those unprepared for the travel.  
*Applicable Knowledge*  
Required:Absolute Summoning  
You can overlay your created worlds onto your surroundings in the same manner as your summons. This can alter terrain, create structures that exist within your worlds, or even provide free access to your world's power sources depending on the purpose of the overlay.  
*Living History*  
Required:True Immortality  
Your worlds are completely a part of you. Their power is your power and vise versa, letting you draw more from them and affect them from outside them.  
*Intruder Alarm*  
Required:Fundamentals  
Your attunement to your planes grows as no matter where in the multiverse you may be, you are intuitively alerted whenever an extraplanar visitor enters one of your planes.  
Absolute Summoning  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:World-Walker  
You don't have to spend time researching or understanding a creature to summon it. Once you have seen a creature, and have sufficient power you can summon it. You can summon multiple copies of the same entity from the Aether. You can even summon new beings you have created from the Aether, and even possibly create creatures from the space between worlds itself.  
*Time Spiral*  
Required:All Angles  
Your ability to surveil other timelines and possibilities before traveling has allowed you to alter your summons, guiding them through speculative paths to emerge as another possible version of the same entity.  
*Invasion*  
Required:Planar Births  
Your creations are now able to traverse the space between worlds alongside you without succumbing to the detrimental effects that follow most of the unprepared. While this is the case, they are still extensions of your will, and cannot survive outside a world for long without your presence and attention.  
*Conflux*  
Required:True Immortality  
Thanks to your understanding of the methods of universal travel, and yours' place within your soul, you can summon other travellers from Aether much like any other summon. This is not the actual traveller, but an accurate enough summon to mimic their main tricks at the point you summon them, like your other summons.  
*Legends*  
Required:Fundamentals  
You can now summon methods of interdimensional travel separate from their user, instilling it into an adjacent form. The travel device of a great inventor may create a blanket field of technological inspiration, for instance, while the portal spell of a particularly destructive mage may become a great battlefield-wide fireball.  
True Immortality  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:World-Walker  
You are truly immortal now. You have no need for a form at all and can survive it's complete destruction. You will need mana to reform them however. As a being of pure magic and will, you are more tied into the flow of mana and can use it to easily track magic or see how spells are formed.  
*Eternal Angles*  
Required:All Angles  
No longer restricted to locations on worlds, you can materialize within the spaces between worlds. While this is potentially useful academically for assessing a world externally, it also allows you to intercept another interdimensional traveller with enough skill.  
*Containing Multitudes*  
Required:Absolute Summoning  
Your Summons are as much a part of you as the power they’re formed from, allowing you to instantly sacrifice them and return their energy to you. Should they die or be removed by other means, this still applies.  
*World's Core*  
Required:Planar Births  
Understanding both the birth of worlds, and the secrets of the soul, you can dictate the metaphysical core of any world you create. The core is the essence of a world, and reflects the world as much as the world reflects it. While designing the core won’t determine everything of the world's nature, it will cement a starting point.  
*Immersion*  
Required:Fundamentals  
Your understanding of your soul, and of your own method of travel itself has finally allowed you to edit your own. Any effect you could have on another, you can do to yourself. Additionally, you now possess the ability to alter your own fundamental connection to universes physics & metaphysics itself, and the identity that once defined you.

Polymath  
Cost: 25 SP  
You are a true genius the likes of Reed Richards, Tony Stark, or Victor von Doom. You have an incredible ability to process and visualize information, a perfect memory, and an incredible capacity to acquire knowledge.  
With reference materials on hand, you can acquire knowledge as fast as you can read. Knowledge builds on itself, the more related fields you master the better understanding of them you develop. You can even discover entirely new fields with some effort by cross-referencing information you already know. While the most obvious application of these abilities is in science and technology, you are by no means limited to it.  
One to three days of study could allow you to learn any skill, be it martial arts or underwater basket weaving, to a point where you are proficient with it, the more you practice any of your skills the better you become. Your rate of progress is dependent on the difficulty of what you are studying, fields such as magic can still take you many decades to master completely. You are however limited to what your body can handle, this power by itself does not allow you to surpass your physical limits or grant you the ability to wield supernatural powers.  
When you acquire new skills and expertise, you will never forget or become incapable of your peak accomplishments. With time you will inevitably become a veritable Swiss Army Knife of incredible scientific knowledge, incredible feats of physical skill and much more. You can reach the power of Atlas in around a decade of study and practice. The more time you dedicate yourself to it, the shorter this time becomes.  
Atlas  
Cost: 35 SP  
Required:Polymath  
You are at the pinnacle of mental prowess. You have a near-limitless capacity to acquire and master skills of any variety, create genius inventions and techniques, and attain within minutes what mastery a lesser man might in lifetimes.  
Moreover, you require no outside knowledge to begin learning these skills, so long as you have sufficient materials. Spend a day in study and develop interplanetary space travel in your backyard. A week, and travel between stars and galaxies. An hour, and develop a cure for mankind's deadliest illnesses. While the most obvious application of these abilities is in science and technology, you are by no means limited to it.  
In mere minutes of observation, you could become a master of martial arts. and in hours be creating fighting styles of your own. A day's practice could make you humanity's greatest detective, its finest doctor, its most talented artist, or its most charismatic leader. Your rate of progress is dependent on the difficulty of what you are studying, fields such as magic can still take you months to years to master completely. You are however limited to what your body can handle, this power by itself does not allow you to surpass your physical limits or grant you the ability to wield supernatural powers.  
When you acquire new skills and expertise, you will never forget or become incapable of your peak accomplishments. With time you will inevitably become a veritable Swiss Army Knife of incredible scientific knowledge, incredible feats of physical skill, and much, much more. In a matter of months, your technologies could advance civilization to its extremes, or make you into a transhumanist god. Nanobot enhancement, genetic recoding, cybernetics, quantum computing, and more may within mere days be in your grasp. Who but you could imagine what might be possible in a year, or a decade? Your talent in all disciplines is quite literally all-encompassing. You are become the overman.  
Advanced Analytics  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Polymath  
You have the ability to comprehend even the most complicated systems from the smallest scraps of information. An accurate but simple description of a phenomenon is sufficient to theorize about the principles that cause it. Simply observing the greatest technological marvels in operation is enough to derive their blueprints, with no need for precise measurements or advanced sensory capabilities. The usual risks of working with flawed information are much less significant to you. If the only possible conclusions from available data are incorrect, you can intuitively sense that further data is needed. Mistakes you make are much more likely to be quantitative than qualitative.  
Quantum Supremacy  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Polymath  
Your computational ability is entirely untethered from any and all limitations of your brain or mind. As long as your understanding is correct and your information sufficient you can perfectly simulate even the most complicated scenarios. This however has little impact on your problem solving capabilities. A blueprint conjured up with barely a thought will still have any flaws inherent to its design and the results of even a perfect simulation have to analyzed in order to understand any implications it might have.  
Toposophic Emergence  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Quantum Supremacy  
You can employ arbitrary numbers of parallel streams of thought, speed up or slow down the perception of time of different portions of your mind.  
Your understanding of yourself is perfect, allowing you to analyze and even dissect your own thinking processes and modify your own mental state and structure at will. With some effort can perfectly predict both the short- and long-term consequences of any changes you can make.  
With repeated analysis and modification you will always discover ways to improve any of your mental capabilities without sacrificing performance in other areas or losing anything that holds even the mildest importance to you. In addition, you are much more resilient against any eldritch truths you might discover and over time will inevitably incorporate them into your understanding of the universe \- no different than the rest of your knowledge.

Jade Disciple  
Cost: 25 SP  
Your Meridians are unlocked and you are capable of circulating Qi through them. You are at the first stage of your chosen cultivation system from any Xianxia or Xuanhuan media, and while you can learn multiple cultivation systems, it is not recommended if you don't have any protections or don't know what you are doing. You can pick up Dharma spells and techniques from any other system, and through arduous training you will be able to refine your body and spirit, to purify your essence, and distill it to attain higher levels. With each level you advance, you are capable of stronger and more fantastic feats.  
You can hone and reinforce your body into a living weapon, force your life force into constructs to do your bidding, become a master of beastly transformations, or a natural at spell formations to turn the elements against your enemies. Whatever your chosen path, you are capable of great things.  
The speed at which you can cultivate and attain higher levels is faster than most cultivators, as you are far more talented than the average cultivator. You can attain the realm/level equivalent to Great Sage in around a decade of regular study and practice. The more time you dedicate yourself to it, the shorter this time becomes.  
An ancient spirit of knowledge has fused with your soul. This spirit is aware of all the core knowledge of cultivation in your system and beyond, meaning that not only would you not lack knowledge in anything related to cultivation and you can commune with this spirit to access their knowledge and learn new techniques or acquire knowledge of how to advance your path, and given enough time how to create your own system.  
Great Sage  
Cost: 35 SP  
Required:Jade Disciple  
Your Meridians are unlocked and you are now a somewhat respectable cultivator in your chosen system. You are capable of using Qi and possess a potent reserve. You have just left the Mortal Realm and are well on your way to become an Immortal Cultivator. While mere mortals will have extreme difficulty wounding you, some Parahumans can bridge the gap somewhat, but in truth, only Endbringers can truly match you, and even then it will not be easy for them to defeat you. You have knowledge of a vast array of Qi techniques in many fields, and a deep knowledge of martial arts.  
An ancient spirit of knowledge has fused with your soul, this spirit is aware of all the core knowledge of cultivation in your system and beyond, meaning that you would not lack knowledge in anything related to cultivation. You can commune with this spirit to access their knowledge and learn new techniques or acquire knowledge of how to advance your path, and given enough time, even how to create your own system.  
Given your level of talent, you cultivate much faster than the normal cultivators. It can take you as little as half the time to advance your realm compared to normal cultivators in your chosen system, and with regular practice and study, you could reduce this time even more.

Required:True Yin Body  
Required:Grand Teacher  
Required:Freak of Nature  
As a protagonist, just about everything will be easier on you.  
You will benefit more from training, becoming much more potent and advanced than other students.  
You have a knack for finding long-lost items of great power and mentors of awe-inspiring might that can let you grow more powerful much more quickly. Techniques and training methods that might as well be cheating will practically fall into your lap.  
Your enemies will have a hell of a time trying to put you down, any victories they have will be Pyrrhic, and as long as your defeat wasn't far too crushing you can bounce back at least somewhat stronger than before.  
You will never be permanently killed by anything so mundane and pathetic as a mere fall down the stairs or choking on your food. Your plot armor is ridiculous, letting you get away scot-free with stuff that would maim or ruin others.  
You will always find some way to defeat your enemy and will always find a means of gaining more power, skill, and influence so long as there is someone or something out there that can challenge you.  
If you are not already, you will even find or get a way to not die of old age, and your life will be easier on you in all ways.  
*The Dark Crow (Emperor's Domination)*  
Required:Immortal Physiques: Pure (Emperor's Domination)  
Required:Immortal Physiques: Taint (Emperor's Domination)  
No one can contest the immense reservoir of knowledge that Li Qiye possesses; his wealth of wisdom is beyond adequate description. Attempting to grasp the magnitude of this is a challenge in itself. Across the expanse of the ten worlds, there exists scarcely a subject or facet he is not intimately acquainted with, from merit laws and techniques to grand daos, ancient history, the locations of invaluable artifacts, and much more. He commands an encyclopedic mastery of the entire epoch's contents, and it's quite conceivable that there's an even greater depth of knowledge he has chosen not to reveal.  
You now inherit the totality of Li Qiye's understanding, willpower, knowledge and memories—every recollection, every experience, down to the minutest detail. This encompasses practical skills like alchemy and flame control, as well as the array of laws contained within his mental sea, which serve as proof of his identity. This includes the various Scriptures and even the technique he devised to cultivate multiple inner physiques. When I say everything, I mean even the knowledge he erased from his mind, all of it, it’s all there. You also gain his ‘profound gaze’, perfect memory, instant perfect recall, and an Index to easily sort through his immense knowledge.  
Furthermore, you gain access to a private pocket dimension that brims with each and every treasure and item that Li Qiye has amassed in his long, long life. Though, do note that you'll be restricted to utilizing only those treasures aligned with your level of prowess, as such most of the treasury may initially be beyond your reach, but over time, you will be worthy to use the entirety of this near-endless treasury. Exclusive access to this pocket dimension is yours alone—any intrusion from other entities will be met with retribution from the very heavens themselves.

Grand Star Meridians Formation  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Jade Disciple  
Your Meridians and the pathways in your body are formed in such a way as to not only make cultivation far easier, but allow you to form multiple golden cores. Eventually forming a stellar golden core array within yourself, making all your golden cores act as one. This would allow you to hold exponentially more Qi than any other cultivator at your level and rival cultivators several levels above your own. This also makes such things as unlocking and mastering your chakras far easier as your body can handle all types of energy far better.  
*Celestial Infinity Devouring Core*  
Required:True Yang Body  
Required:True Yin Body  
You hold within your being the very heavenly bodies themselves.  
From these celestial objects, you can create a singularity of fearsome and unrivaled power.  
Nine Suns to carve a bottomless hole, dark as the Primordial void, Twelve Moons to forge a spiral crown, luminous as the Primordial spark.  
Upon the full formation of the Stellar Golden Core Array, you are able to take the 9 suns and 12 moons to form the summit of potential in your Qi circulatory system, sacrificing them, allowing you to store a potentially infinite amount of Qi. Your Stellar Core Array will feed the hungering singularity within, increasing the speed, and efficiency of your Cultivation by one hundred and eight times. The power and swiftness of your Qi circulation are likewise enhanced, empowering all your techniques to a truly massive degree, as if the galactic core followed in their wake. Finally, your affinity for all Qi types is raised to the absolute pinnacle of potential.  
*Tribulation​ ​Taker*  
Required:Freak of Nature  
Tribulations are the one thing that strikes fear into the hearts of cultivators everywhere. The fear of utter annihilation with no chance of survival is enough to make the hearts of countless cultivators go numb. Not for you, however, because you have conquered possibly the greatest hurdle that blocks your cultivation.  
Tribulations never actually exceed what you could deal with, and before the advent of your tribulations you always get clear, if not completely prophetic feelings, nudging you towards the exact date of its occurrence.  
*A Dangerous Road*  
Required:Grand Teacher  
You can navigate harsh terrains as though they were little more than friendly grasslands. Deep snow and sand, swamps, mountains, canyons, ruins, lush jungles, and even great bodies of water are no challenge to you.  
If you desire you may allow yourself to ‘travel where the wind blows’, often times leading you to places of unexpected beauty, significance, or power.

True Yang Body  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Jade Disciple  
Your body is uniquely suited for Yang-aligned energy and thoughts. You can advance in Yang-aligned techniques with ease and cultivate significantly faster when taking paths that are Yang-aligned.  
*Nine Sun Primordial*  
Required:Grand Star Meridians Formation  
You have nine suns in your body that you can cultivate and grow. Adding them to your actions, such as hitting someone with the force of a sun, or unleashing their flames and heat. You start with one small sun which grows as you absorb Yang-aligned energy.  
*Perfect Foundation*  
Required:True Yin Body  
A solid foundation is one of the pillars that support cultivators in advancing. An unstable and shallow foundation would often lead to a failed breakthrough and at worst death.  
With this you have a perfect and regenerating foundation. Your foundation automatically corrects any imperfections and defects in your cultivation caused by using external materials like pills, treasures, wrong cultivation techniques and many more.  
Additionally, your cultivation base cannot be crippled under any circumstances.  
Any conflicts with using two or more cultivation systems will be prevented, going so far as to allow you to progress in a system even when it should be impossible due to the nature of your advancements in the others.  
*Swiftly Advancing*  
Required:Freak of Nature  
You are inherently skilled with cultivation. Your training is ten times more effective than before, which by itself would probably put you on the edge of being a “Young Genius”. However, this boost actually doubles when you are learning things for yourself, rather than learning from a mentor, and removes all penalties which you might otherwise experience from the lack of instruction.  
Any result of your breakthroughs will always have the highest results and you will never experience any bottlenecks that would prevent you from advancing. As a bonus this also prevents you from ever failing in advancing your cultivation systems, no matter the reason.  
*Peerless Genius*  
Required:Grand Teacher  
Your combat strength is far, far more important than your cultivation speed.  
You have the ability and talent to use your cultivation realm, combat skills, and techniques beyond their original capabilities without overdrawing or receiving significant damage to yourself.  
This allows you to become invincible to those of the same level, be capable of fighting and winning against those that have a half-realm above you, and become equal to those that are one realm higher.  
As a bonus this also greatly increases your cunning, wits and combat awareness in battle, allowing you to outmaneuver and use the environment to the fullest to emerge victorious even fighting a group a half-realm higher than you.

True Yin Body  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Jade Disciple

*Twelve Moon Primordial*  
Required:Grand Star Meridians Formation  
You have twelve moons in your body that you can cultivate and grow. Adding them to your actions, such as hitting someone with the force of a moon, or unleashing frost and entropy. You start with one small moon which grows as you absorb Yin-aligned energy.  
*Body of the Reaction God*  
Required:True Yang Body  
A very important way used to improve one’s strength and abilities in this world is the use of herbs and medicines, and certain other substances such as crystals and other supplements.  
You are especially fortunate in such things, possessing a body and soul that allows you to reap over thrice the normal rewards from any such methods you use. Regardless of whether they affect your body, soul or meridians, the rewards are immense enough to leave even veteran experts mind boggled.  
At the same time, the harmful effects of any resources that normally would need to be processed to be consumed safely are entirely removed.  
*Thousands of Steps*  
Required:Grand Teacher  
You gain the ability to plan thousands upon thousands of steps ahead, capable of predicting thousands of unknown factors be it in combat to economics up to managing enormous empires.  
The longer and farther reaching the plan the more solid and better it is, and once the plan is started someone cannot stop it with brute force alone unless they know everything about your plans or have strength enough to make you helpless.  
You also gain the ability to recognize plots and schemes that involve you unknowingly and instinctively know how to escape or ruin them.  
*Army Defying*  
Required:Freak of Nature  
You cannot be overwhelmed by mere numbers. If an enemy would not present a threat to you in a one-on-one battle, then any number of similarly skilled foes are equally useless in the face of your martial prowess.

Grand Teacher  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Jade Disciple  
Passing your skills onto the next generation is the foundation of mortal society, what allows it to grow. The same thing could be said for immortal cultivators, but for the many mortals who populate the world, honing your life’s craft and passing it on to your progeny is a vital part of  
ensuring that their legacy continues. Be it wood carving, blacksmithing, painting or stranger.  
You are a teacher and tutor without peer, capable of easily passing along your skills and  
knowledge to anyone who wants to learn from you. Beneath your gentle hand, even a moron  
could become a master of their craft in a mere fraction of the time it would have taken an  
average person. And if you were to teach that same average person? Their rate of growth and comprehension would have to be seen to be believed.  
Even the most complicated and intricate systems, concepts or philosophies can be explained to anyone regardless of their pre-existing knowledge base and if you truly know better than someone then they will realize this rather than allow pre-conceptions, arrogance or outdated thinking to blind them to your teachings.  
This will also allow you to awaken the Meridians of any mortal and teach them the art of cultivation.  
*Master and Disciples*  
Required:Freak of Nature  
You are able to teach any learnable skill you possess, so long as they can be learned and taught rather than innate.  
Your students advance in their learning by leaps and bounds in their studies under your personal tutelage, acquiring in days what would take others years to obtain. By the time they have completed their training, they will be just as competent as you are in these skills and will never forget what you have imparted.  
Your students have an innate sense of loyalty to you and won’t betray you for their own gains.  
*Revered Ancestor*  
Required:True Yin Body  
As an elder, you are the rock upon which your clan or sect rests. You are easily capable of inspiring awe and near worship in those weaker or simply less knowledgeable than you. The quantity and quality of people that you can draw in this way will naturally increase as you grow stronger and greater than them.  
Unlike many elders in this world, however, you are immune to betrayal from beneath by the simple fact that your people simply cannot betray you. The thought will never cross their minds and even supernatural coercion or interrogation cannot force them to betray your secrets or your trust.  
*Guiding Instinct*  
Required:Grand Star Meridians Formation  
You are able to figure out what is best in the way of training. Given the choice of ten different teachers, you would be able to figure out which of them is the best for you, or for another, with minimal information about each teacher.  
You also would be able to figure out how to use any technique no matter how poor your instruction, provided you are able to learn it to begin with.  
*A Cave Filled with Wonders*  
Required:True Yang Body  
There are places laden with riches, resources, the artifacts of legend, hidden techniques, and heaven-defying cultivation methods.  
You are now capable of finding and obtaining all of that with very little effort or time on your part. That which was hidden can be coaxed into your lap like a river flowing into a lake.  
Combined with the A Dangerous Road Addon it almost seems as if you were destined to be guided to such things, and they to you.

Freak of Nature  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Jade Disciple  
You are now something else, something different... You are an absolute freak of nature in the arts of cultivation and understanding of the Dao. mastering any Dao/aspect of cultivation to Grand levels would take you maybe thirty years or so, and reaching a God Realm would take you thousands of years rather than the tens/hundreds of thousands years it might take others through sheer brute force. Even becoming a True immortal would be an inevitability rather than a mere possibility, though the time it would take you could vary widely. And that’s without any specializations. You may pick a personal Dao and one aspect of Cultivation such as Formations, Beast Arts, Sword Arts, Spacetime, etc, in which you absolutely excel, to the point where it would allow you to fight others one realm higher than you, and train in it at an absolutely astonishing pace  
*Heightened Instincts*  
Required:True Yang Body  
Your instincts are improved and strengthened to near precognition, allowing you to sense and predict any incoming attacks or danger to yourself no matter how exotic it is. You will instinctively know the exact location of the attacker, where the dangerous places around you are, and if someone has ill intent for you.  
You also gain the ability to instinctively evade any attacks that can harm you and minimize it should the attack be too fast for your body to evade.  
The range of this ability scales with your cultivation and experience.  
*Martial Innovator*  
Required:Grand Teacher  
Normally a cultivator would just follow the footsteps of the predecessors, only learning and mastering existing techniques without any innovation, with only those that reach the high levels of cultivation creating new ones.  
But now, you can create new ideas, innovations, variations and applications from existing techniques, as well as merging two or more techniques into one unique technique. This also applies to fusing two or more elements, concepts, etc. into one, with the result possessing all of their advantages and none of their weaknesses or drawbacks.  
This also allows you to upgrade or improve existing cultivation techniques as well as re-creating missing and incomplete techniques. With the help of this upgrade making truly heaven-defying techniques or even greater would be a lot easier and creating cultivation methods appropriate to your cultivation realm are also possible.  
*Bewildering Brilliance*  
Required:True Yin Body  
To succeed in this world, you must be a great genius like no other, even among the luminaries of your generation. With this, you will be.  
Your rate of learning new things, techniques, ideas, and even entirely new arts is something almost beyond imagining. You are a genius, the kind of person who can master entire martial styles, or new fields of practice, in days, weeks at the most.  
This doesn’t just affect your mind, either. Your body can keep up perfectly with everything your mind learns, growing at an equal pace with every new insight you gain.  
*Good Breeding*  
Required:Grand Star Meridians Formation  
You possess significant beauty, charisma, and social skills. Those who interact with you in an amicable manner find it a joy to continue their relationship with you, whatever it may be. You know your way around society, and society will gladly accommodate you.  
In addition, you find it easier to learn the ways of foreign civilizations, and foreigners will tend to treat you better than they would have without this power.

Sorcerer Apprentice  
Cost: 25 SP  
Your ability to manipulate Mana, one of the fundamental energies of the multiverse, is unlocked. Your mana core has just formed and starts with a small capacity to store and transfer mana but it can be increased through practice and rituals. You have an innate knowledge of the basic elements of the three fundamental branches of mana manipulation.  
Conjuration, the shaping of mana into constructs that produce an effect. More commonly known as spells, your library contains information about many different systems of magic and with perseverance you might discover the secrets of True Magic.  
Enchantment, the creation of objects powered by Mana, capable of producing the same effects as Conjuration but anchored to objects.  
And Alchemy, the creation and transformation of materials and liquids with Mana. From potions producing effects when ingested to esoteric metals and gems to use in Enchantments, the creation of devices, or armor.  
A library of grimoires about the three branches of mana manipulation has been implanted into your memory as well. You will still need to read and understand them and acquire the necessary skills but all the knowledge you need is at your fingertips. With this power, you can reproduce any magic system from first principles and even create your own. The library contains several broad magic systems to get you started.  
While this ability has no theoretical upper limit, the more complex and powerful Conjurations will test your knowledge. Over time, as your understanding of mana expands, you can discover new branches of magic beyond the primary three. With enough time you will be able to reach heights only the gods can dream of but be careful not to break reality or destroy your soul on your journey there. You can reach the power of Sorcerer Supreme in around a decade of study and practice. The more time you dedicate yourself to it, the shorter this time becomes.

Beloved by Magic  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Sorcerer Apprentice  
There are dozens of ways this is described throughout different magical cultures but they all boil down to the same thing, being loved by magic itself. You have instinctual perfect control over all your magic, requiring barely a flicker of thought to gather your Mana. Spells you cast have no charge-up time and come into effect nearly instantaneously. This has also allowed you to remove all impurities from your mana causing magical creatures and sensitive mages to adore your presence and grow stronger from it, as it shows them what it means to be loved by Magic itself.  
*Paradise*  
Required:Infused with Mana  
Your spells and Mana remain under your control, unable to be influenced by outside sources. This results in your spells becoming eternal, unaffected by the passage of time. You have the ability to convert one form of magical energy into another with perfect efficiency as they all pale in comparison to pure Mana. There are many ways to use Magic, and for you, insofar as casting methods are concerned, there are no hard limits. Your entire body is your greatest magical focus allowing you to cast spells in ways their Magic Systems might not normally allow. Some examples are silent casting verbal magic and wandless casting wand magic.  
*Ignition*  
Required:Core Matrix  
You are able to ignite a Mana seed in an individual, allowing them to eventually grow into a sorcerer of the same type as you. People you awaken can gain a spirit version of you, whether they receive this spirit version of you is dependent on your will. This spirit will simply be another portion of your mind that you are able to access at any time. You will receive a copy of every single spell your students use and create. You are able to give a student direction experience using a spell you wish to teach.  
*Stable Care*  
Required:Attunement  
You have removed all inefficiencies and waste from your magic as well as improved their stability. Such is your mastery of magic that spells you cast no longer interfere with each other unless that is your intention. Casting a fireball that is covered by ice can be done with ease, unleashing the fire inside upon impact. You may make dastardly creations like Frostfire or Fiendfyre with ease. When you speak, Magic listens, even without the direct intent of casting magic you will find that on occasion an opponent's spell will misfire, or be slightly off course when they had you dead to rights. Maybe your healer's spell is much more effective than it should have been when they went to heal you.  
*Meta-Magic*  
Required:Artifact Extraordinaire  
You create spells with ease as if there was never any concern for failure. The more you use a spell, the stronger it gets, this is because your spells accrue damage multipliers for enemies defeated or an increase in efficiency for an incredible feat. Killing a dragon with a basic magic missile could have your magic missiles become increasingly effective against all further dragons you face off against. Defending a city with a barrier spell with having that barrier spell could have your barriers begin to protect your charges against more than physical or magical damage, possibly protecting them from things like heartbreak. These extra modifiers are entirely optional and only apply when you wish them to.

Infused with Mana  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Sorcerer Apprentice  
Every cell in your body is saturated with the fundamental force that is Mana. Due to this, when wielded by you, magic can't be suppressed or snuffled, and all attempts to block it failed. Your spells grow more potent and any consequences from dangerous magic or misspells are greatly mitigated. You are also particularly skilled at preparing contingent spells allowing them to be cast whenever some pre-chosen conditions are fulfilled, such spells can activate even if you are asleep, incapacitated, or even dead.  
*Absolute Magic*  
Required:Beloved by Magic  
Mana is a fundamental energy of the Universe and when in your hands it can't be suppressed or snuffed off, your magical effects can now ignore any innate magical resistances or protections. Your internally cast spells will begin to increase in power at no cost or thought the longer they are stored for. Your body is constantly shifting to be in peak condition, and your innate magic resistance is in line with those of the strongest Dragons. Even when you die you can enter a temporary form of undeath that will last until you are able to resurrect yourself.  
*Growing Resistance*  
Required:Core Matrix  
Each specialized Core gives you an innate resistance to that type of magic, the more specific the specialization the better the resistance. Spells you store in your body can be unleashed at once without regard for your normal multi-casting limit. You are able to cast grand rituals requiring dozens of participants using your entire body as an instrument of magic.  
*Perpetual Refinement*  
Required:Attunement  
You are magic in motion, constantly refining yourself with every action. Walking enough could have each and every step take you farther than you could possibly stride, eventually moving miles with each step without any thought required. Wanting to hide could allow you to shrink yourself or possibly jump into a shadow to avoid detection. Casting the same spell over and over again could see the Mana required dip to almost nothing. When you attempt to improve these things they will increase in bounds greater than they would passively.  
*Legacy*  
Required:Artifact Extraordinaire  
You are able to turn your stored spells into Legacy spells, reducing the amount of Mana required to cast them. Legacy spells gain more power the more you use them and are able to be passed down to your children through your genetics. You are able to cast an intricate ritual to adopt someone into your Legacy. As the founder of these Legacy spells you gain more power as more individuals gain access to, and use your Legacy spells.

Core Matrix  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Sorcerer Apprentice  
You are able to form a magic seed that will grow into a Nascent Mana Core, the additional core then will grow at an increased rate until it catches up to your main core. In addition to this increased rate of passive growth, the effects of practice and rituals are multiplied by your total number of cores. Once your new core has caught up to your main core, you may link your cores together allowing all linked cores to share the same amount of growth across one another.

Each additional core allows you another 'instance' of casting, multiplicatively increasing the number of spells you can cast simultaneously. You can cast spells and grant rituals that require multiple people on your own by using linked cores as a fill-in for another person.  
Once you have linked the newest core you may begin to form another seed. Each additional core linked increases your Mana Concentration, allowing you to get more Magic out of a smaller quantity of Mana. Linked cores also increase your total Mana throughput, allowing you to cast both a higher quality and quantity of spells at once. You may repeat this process infinitely as there is no limit to the number of cores you can have.  
Once you have linked your third core, you may begin to permanently designate cores as specialized, allowing them to perform a specific branch of magic at a much higher level than a regular core. The specialization can be something as broad as Conjuration, or something as niche as Repair of Small Objects, though the broader it is, the lesser the boost it provides. Each specialized core forms a unique ability fit for whichever has been selected. It is up to you to form your own path beyond this step. Nothing is off-limits for you in regards to magic, only time will be able to stop you, and not for much longer.  
*Specialist*  
Required:Beloved by Magic  
The unique abilities given to your specialized cores are even stronger. Cores no longer receive a weaker boost for broader specializations. You may strengthen the Core-granted abilities, and with enough time and effort, they can reach Isekai Cheat Skill levels of power. You are now able to give each Core two specializations, they can be the same or different, and the ability to reflect this combination.  
*Superior Soil*  
Required:Infused with Mana  
Your Mana-infused body allows for incredible passive growth for all your seeds and Cores, which begin to constantly take Mana from your cells at no cost to you. This passive growth receives the same multiplier that the effects of practice and rituals have, a multiplier based on your total number of cores. Eventually, you will be able to plant multiple magic seeds at the same time, with no reduction in growth speed.  
*Shortcut*  
Required:Attunement  
You are able to cast spells with ambient magic. These spells cast will be weaker than if you were to cast with your own Mana, but they will still be affected by your Core-granted abilities and have no magical cost on your end. Specialized Cores occasionally give you a high-level insight into whatever the target specialization is. These insights will qualitatively affect all spells of the specialization’s magic.  
*Connect Cores*  
Required:Artifact Extraordinaire  
You are able to link a Core to an artifact, binding it to yourself until you unlink it. The linked artifact will receive the linked growth of your cores with the same multiplier. These artifacts can be utterly destroyed and will be reformed inside of your Core in due time. These artifacts will receive increased benefits depending on what the linked Core’s specialization is.

Attunement  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Sorcerer Apprentice  
You are attuned to magical forces to a high extent. You can intuitively feel the flows and nature of magic, and you can sometimes have flashes of inspiration that let you figure things out or invent a new spell. Eventually, you will be able to copy any spell you see and send it back to the caster improved. When working with magic you will find that everything just comes easier to you, to the point that you are able to just will your magic together in hopes of a certain effect and have it succeed. Your spells will passively refine themselves to be more in line with what you want. The limitations of magic break down in front of your very eyes when researching for long enough.  
*Return to Sender*  
Required:Beloved by Magic  
You are able to identify spells by feeling alone, allowing you to sense an opponent's spell before it has even been cast and form a counterspell with enough practice. Flashes of insight can occur with a much higher frequency, always in a subject, you would appreciate. With enough practice, you could even break down a spell before it has been fully formed.  
*Analysis*  
Required:Infused with Mana  
You can gain a mental image of an object you lay hands on down to the molecular level. You replicate anything you scan with ease, no matter how magically complicated it is. Your contingency spells are able to gain a slice of your mind no matter the conditions, allowing you to no longer have to worry about limited activating conditions. Your entire body acts as a magnifier for your Mana sense, increasing your detection radius by a magnitude.  
*Whisper*  
Required:Core Matrix  
Your Cores will constantly grant low levels of insight without conscious thought or direction, this insight is always in an area of magic you would appreciate. Each specialized Core grants you an incredible affinity to whatever magic is chosen, a Core specialized in Spatial Magic could have you developing a fine level of spatial awareness, and a Core specialized in Book Magic could have you develop an intuition toward sources of important arcane knowledge. These affinities are not static things, growing as you use and experience more.  
*Substitute*  
Required:Artifact Extraordinaire  
You are able to identify all sorts of magical materials through feel alone, be they metals, plants, or mixtures. With enough practice, you could even replace materials with your own Mana in their place. Making a sword with no forge, replacing a rare ingredient with your own magic to form a potion, the possibilities are endless. Your magic will remember all of the forms it has taken, only having to achieve a form once in order for you to replicate it again with ease, no matter the initial challenge.  
Artifact Extraordinaire  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Sorcerer Apprentice  
You are able to craft magical items akin to Excalibur and Avalon. Every material you use for Enchantment and Alchemy can be enhanced to its best natural quality, rusty scraps turn to fresh, perfectly forged metals, and burnt-out unhealthy plants shift into well-cared-for alchemic ingredients through the infusion of Mana. You are able to create items that will grow as they are used, armor that becomes more resistant as it withstands more. Magical Foci are perfectly fit for their wielder and can be made with ease.  
*Spiritual*  
Required:Beloved by Magic  
Your enchantments are always better than you plan for, as magic itself will ensure you always receive its aid. This could be something as simple as shoring up the weaknesses in your enchantment, or something as major as cementing an item's legacy, allowing it to be soul bound to a lineage it was designed for. Your artifacts will even be able to grow a limited form of awareness due if you so wish.  
*Retract*  
Required:Infused with Mana  
You are able to retract enchantments from your magical artifacts, storing them inside your body, allowing you to apply them to another item at any time. These stored enchantments will gain more and more power the longer they are stored. With enough practice, you will be able to gift these enchantments to other people through some marking, be it a tattoo, crest, or what have you.  
*Gardener*  
Required:Core Matrix  
You may go beyond the creation of simple golems, shaping magic into people underneath your hands. You may plant a magic seed inside of an artifact that will grow into an ego, when applied correctly you are able to give life to a new person with enough time and care. You may use a magic seed to make a Magical Focus the world has never seen before, the magic seed can instead bind to the next person that picks up the artifact, or be a person of your choice.  
*Enlightenment*  
Required:Attunement  
You are able to meditate on an enchantment you wish to design and will find some form of insight if you ponder it long enough.

Upon administration, recipients not only acquire superhuman strength, speed, agility, and endurance, surpassing the limits of ordinary humans, but they also tap into the enigmatic power of the "void." This connection to the "void" personality of the Sentry grants them a second set of powers that defy comprehension. These additional abilities are often linked to reality manipulation, energy projection, and the ability to traverse dimensions. With the infusion of the Sentry Serum, individuals become vessels of immense power, wielding both the might of a million exploding suns and the mysterious forces of the "void" entity. The Sentry Super Soldier Serum bestows a dual nature upon its recipients, making them forces to be reckoned with in the realms of both physical prowess and esoteric capabilities.

All the World's Evil  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:Blood of the 72 Pillars (DxD)  
Required:The King of Fear And Curses  
Ascend to the pinnacle of darkness as All the World's Evil, an entity that embodies the culmination of negative forces. With this upgrade, the potency of your power is magnified to unfathomable levels, surpassing even the mightiest super devils. Your body, a compressed negative dimension of evil, sin, death, fear, curse, and more, radiates an aura that strikes terror into the hearts of all who behold you.  
As All the World's Evil, you possess innate absolute mastery over demonic energy, dwarfing even the most formidable devils in its manipulation. Your demonic energy is fused with curse energy and fear energy, creating a primordial energy that transcends individual forms, granting you unprecedented control over the essence of darkness itself.

Required:Cursed Spirit (Jujutsu Kaisen)  
Embrace the pinnacle of terror as The King of Fear and Curses, combining the potent forces of Primordial Terror and Cursed Spirit. With this upgrade, your power reaches unparalleled heights, granting you true conceptual immortality, ensuring that as long as the fears you embody exist, you cannot die.  
As The King of Fears, your power expands beyond the confines of a single fear, allowing you to embody multiple fears simultaneously, each fear enhancing and complementing the others in a twisted synergy that ensures you dwarf even the most potent Primordial Fears. This versatility grants you unparalleled control over the essence of fear and curse itself.

Primordial Terror (Chainsaw Man)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:What Do You Fear? (Chainsaw Man)  
Tap into the primordial fears that have haunted humanity throughout the ages and transform into a Devil that embodies these ancient terrors.

As you activate this ability, an overwhelming aura of dread emanates from you, striking fear into the hearts of all who cross your path.  
Your powers surge, granting you the ability to manipulate and command the very essence of your chosen primordial fear. For instance, as a Darkness Devil, you can shroud your surroundings in impenetrable darkness, distorting space-time and instilling primal terror with your mere presence. Witnessing your true form can even break the minds of those unfortunate enough to lay eyes upon you.  
The strength of your abilities is directly linked to the intensity of fear harboured by humanity towards the primordial concept you embody. The deeper their fear, the more potent and devastating your powers become, drawing strength from the collective nightmares of mankind. Additionally, you possess the power to form contracts with humans, empowering them with a fraction of your terrifying abilities. However, these allies must be willing to bear the cost and consequences that come with harnessing your primordial fear.

Doomsday (DC Comics)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:(Wo)Man of Steel (DC Comics)  
Required:Gamma Mutate (Marvel)  
Thanks to a synthesis between your Gamma Mutation and Kryptonian physiology, you had unlocked a transformation evocative of Doomsday, an ancient experiment created in efforts to create the Ultimate Lifeform through continuous “stress testing”, eventually forming within the creature innate hate to Life from its constant deaths and tribulations.  
The transformation is quite peculiar, with no baggage from Doomsday itself such as its unending vitriol for all that lives and its compulsive desire to kill it, and your transition between your base form and your Doomsday form is seemingly smooth… at first. As you become more accustomed to your new form, you will find it harder to revert back the longer you stay transformed, with the ultimate risk of never being able to change back into your original form.  
This metamorphosis essentially turns you into the ultimate killing machine, all physical abilities such their strength, speed, durability, and endurance are nothing but comparable to the paragons such as Superman in his prime with nothing holding him back, or Martian Manhunter at his most desperate, on top of your natural weaponry coming from your bone protrusions serving both as defense and offense. Its most prominent abilities are its adaptive resurrection and regeneration, both abilities elevating the beast to the threat it is known to today: Adaptive Resurrection assures you adapt to whatever it kills you, becoming either resistant or outright immune to it afterward, while Adaptive Regeneration ensures your survival no matter the obstacle or environment.

Fel Beast  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Doomsday (DC Comics)  
Required:World Breaker (Marvel)  
Required:Atom Bomb (Marvel)  
Your Doomsday form has been tainted, and saturated with the Fel fires of the Twisting Nether. Your Doomsday form’s physical abilities had been vastly empowered to a destructive scale, with a humongous size to boot. This corruption has a few destructive advantages, though, with projecting and breathing uncountable amounts of Fel energy, causing untold havoc and destruction to both your surroundings and unfortunate enemies.

Another feature resulting from your poisoning is the resulting creation of your personal infection: The Doomsday Virus, taking the toxic and infectious characteristics of the Fel and incorporating it into yourself, being capable of generating viral spores able to turn anyone into a being like yourself or if it's too much of a dosage, begin to rot and die, effectively dissolving them.

Super Saiyan 4 (Dragon Ball Series)  
Cost: 25 SP  
Required: Half-Saiyan (Dragon Ball Series), or Bio-Android (Dragon Ball Series)  
You have pushed your limits beyond: attaining the form of a Golden Great Ape while retaining your humanity in control. Everything that is the Great Ape form has been condensed within you, causing your power to explode into a new tier. Your power is the stuff of legends and is great enough to fast track you to the status of God of Destruction, should you wish to go that route.  
Taking this form adorns your body in a crimson fur and matching lining around your eyes; should you not be in your prime body, your body will transform into the prime of your adult body while maintaining this power. The mastery over your ki has smoothed it to the point of lacking any electrical discharges in your golden aura.

This form takes you to the edge of your limits, in every regard. You can easily be considered thousands of times more powerful than your base form and can supercharge any of your signature abilities by several orders of magnitudes. You have the ability to absorb the energy of your opponent's attacks to strengthen your own, and an ability to adapt to your opponent's attacks in real time. Most attacks will only be capable of harming or affecting you once or twice before this form naturally adapts your defenses to leave you unaffected.  
This form perfects everything about you for the purpose of defeating your opponent, whether that boosts your battle IQ, numbs your rationality, or simply banishes your mental blocks to violence. This perfection means that it will take negligible amounts of ki to remain in this form, and you will never have to worry about stamina issues.  
*Limit Breaker*  
Required:God Ki (Dragon Ball Series)  
Whatever method you used to break the limits of mortals to obtain God Ki has filled you to the brim with ki. Your fur takes on a more magenta coloration and your hair becomes more crimson as your God Ki flows through you. Your aura takes on a purple-flowing appearance with a skin-tight white aura that remains with or without your primary aura.  
Your power in this form explodes further, granting you the power to fight with even more of the most powerful warriors in the universe. This form causes you to transcend past the limits of your previous form. Entering this form is capable of completely restoring you to full power should you have been on the losing side before.  
*Hakaishin*  
Required:Ultra Ego (Dragon Ball Series)  
In each universe, there is a being in charge of keeping the balance of life and death. This being is known as a God of Destruction, a creature of almost unlimited power that destroys entire worlds that have run their course or disturbed the balance, working in tandem with the Supreme Kai to create and destroy as needed. You have become a God of Destruction, a being that is only outmatched by the Angels and a scant few mortals of terrifying might. Your Destruction ability has been increased, matching that of Beerus, allowing you to direct your ki to destroy things with a touch, obliterating even ghosts or souls that draw your ire. You can use it without being focused on destruction and nothing else.

You also gain access to a perfected and mastered version of Ultra Ego, which not only grants the power increase from damage of the Ultra Ego State but without the heightened battle lust if you choose to, this also makes you exponentially more powerful than before and allows your power to progress faster without instinct as your fighting spirit increases.

Optionally, you may receive an Angel companion of your own design. They will both serve you and help train you. They are irrevocably loyal to you and come with an Angel Attendant's Staff. While being immune to any rules an Angel has to follow, they will guide you in learning the martial arts and in how to maintain a universe's health, as well as almost any other subject you care to take an interest in.  
Last but not least, you now gain access to an entire universe along with its own Supreme Kai for you to maintain over.

Potential Unleashed (Dragon Ball Series)  
Cost: 20 SP  
You have undergone Old Kai’s ritual and have had your latent potential unlocked. Not only that but your latent potential rivals even Gohan. What this means is that you can use all your potential strength and energy whenever you want and can even focus your power to go beyond your full potential.  
Being able to use your full potential has the neat side effect of removing the limit of how much power you can harness at once and how fast you can harness it, removing the strain of their usage. An example of these limitations would be having an ocean of Ki but only being able to bring it out with a garden hose, with strain being any added pressure to the hose to make it go faster.  
Your potential isn’t stagnant either, with training it is possible to have even more potential. By that same token however, it is also possible to lose your potential if you slack off training and do nothing with it. The same man who was bedridden can become an Olympic Athlete after all.

This doesn’t just apply to your physical strength, but every power that draws from yourself. In the case of a power being more external, you can more easily draw that power into yourself. It should be known that doing this recklessly may make you explode.

Inspector Gadget (Inspector Gadget)  
Cost: 30 SP  
Your body has been surgically enhanced, allowing you to produce any type of gadget from your body. These gadgets can be released instantly and are fully integrated into your physical form, making them accessible at any time. As long as the gadgets do not exceed your body's size, you can produce as many as you need, making you a versatile and unpredictable threat in any combat scenario. The gadgets can range from simple tools to high-tech weapons and can be customized to suit your needs and preferences. Your ability to produce gadgets on demand makes you a formidable and adaptable foe, able to adapt to any situation and exploit your opponent's weaknesses.

The Greater Nobility (Vampire Hunter D)  
Cost: 35 SP  
Congratulations\! By acquiring this power, you ascend to the esteemed status of a Greater Noble Vampire, an elite lineage that has reigned over both humankind and vampire-kind for countless millennia. As a Greater Noble, your attributes receive a massive boost, including a truly impressive immortality that would baffle even gods, restoring your physical body from any injury by warping space-time itself. Your powers far surpass those of ordinary vampires, and even the traditional weaknesses of your kind hold little sway over you. You can be atomized and still return to the realm of the living, fully intact and with all your possessions in pristine condition. Only exposure to sunlight, a stake through the heart, or by negating your immortality can others even begin to pose a threat to your existence, however with all these gifts comes the thirst for blood.

But that's not all—your chosen attribute, be it strength, speed, or intelligence, undergoes an unprecedented augmentation. The boost is so immense that it surpasses even the capabilities of other Greater Nobles. With enhanced speed, you can traverse vast distances in an instant, leaving infinity in your wake. Opting for strength empowers you to effortlessly create chasms as deep as the Mariana Trench with a single, unintentional swing of your sword. And if you select intelligence, your mind blazes brighter than the sun, far surpassing even the most brilliant geniuses. Additionally, your intellect grants you immunity to mind control, and illusions become mere child's play for you to decipher and overcome.  
*The Ascendant Dhampir*  
Required: The Progenitor of Man (Records of Ragnarok), or The Furtive Pygmy (Dark Souls)  
Congratulations\! You have ascended above the limitation of Man and Vampire and became a Dhampir. As the ultimate fusion of mankind and the Greater Nobility, your power and influence are unparalleled.

Your supernatural adaptability and evolution have been magnified to unfathomable levels. You possess the ability to adapt to any situation or opponent, gaining new abilities and strengths as needed. Your physical body is a marvel, capable of enduring immense punishment and regenerating from even the most catastrophic injuries by manipulating the fabric of space-time, agility fast enough to traverse vast distances in an instant, leaving infinity in your wake, strength to effortlessly create chasms as deep as the Mariana Trench with a single, unintentional swing of your sword, and an intelligence mind shining brighter than the sun, far surpassing even the most brilliant geniuses. Your form is both divine and human, lacking all the weakness of a vampire and radiating a beauty that captivates even the gods and embodying the epitome of grace and strength, to put it simply you are the equal of the legendary vampire hunter D.

The Eyes of The Lord, granted to you as the Progenitor of Man, are further enhanced. They allow you to create perfect counters by studying your enemies' original powers, abilities, and techniques, and developing mirror opposite powers that neutralize them. This follows the Dualism Theory of man, ensuring that your chance of victory never goes below 50% regardless of the situation or enemy faced. Additionally, as more enemies gather against you, your strength increases exponentially, making it impossible for anyone to defeat you unless they possess abilities equal to yours.

With your unmatched power and adaptability, you stand as an indomitable force. No numerical advantage can overcome your might, and victory is assured as long as your adversaries lack the same level of ability as you.

Original Vampire (Originals)  
Cost: 25 SP  
A long time ago, there was a family that had just lost their child to a werewolf. In an effort to protect their children, the mother, who was a witch, found a spell that could protect their children and the parents from ever feeling the loss again. However, she did not use the original spell and modified it twice, adding to it. You have been transformed into one of these vampires, being one of the original lines of vampires. As a creature of the night reanimated through magic, you have several powers because your physiology has changed, giving you superhuman abilities.

As an original vampire, your superhuman strength allows you to toss humans around like nothing, crush buildings to pieces, and, with enough effort, destroy an island. Depending on how old you are, your abilities could be much stronger. You also possess superhuman speed and agility, being able to move faster than human eyes can see. Even some supernatural creatures with enhanced senses can't keep up with you, and your reaction time is just as fast. Your senses have also been enhanced by being able to hear conversions from blocks away from the source, smell things from the side of a city, and see in complete darkness. Along with the super strength comes increased durability that allows you to take blows that would destroy buildings just fine and a regenerative healing factor that can heal anything within seconds, so long as you have not been beheaded. Like all vampires, you have immortality.

Besides the physical powers, you also possess mental abilities that are supernatural in nature. Being able to enter and influence the minds of others, controlling thoughts or influencing them, erasing memories, creating illusions, and more.

The vampires you create are loyal to you. Vampires also possess some minor miscellaneous abilities like controlling the weather, controlling small animals like wolves or birds, manipulating elements, shutting off their own emotions, flying, and even shape-shifting.

*Hybrid*  
Required:Original Vampire (Originals)  
You are the product of unholy combinations; the only other hybrid was made when the mother had an affair with a werewolf. Being the unnatural combination of the original vampire and werewolf, you have undergone a metamorphosis as your abilities are enhanced well beyond those of either supernatural species. Your strength has surpassed that of an original vampire, and you could go against an original vampire older than yourself, being able to easily destroy islands and break continents with enough effort. Your vampiric speed has combined with the speed and agility of the wolf being able to go around at speeds massively higher than hypersonic and, with effort, break into the speed of light.

You may also now control your werewolf side and combine the forms into one, enhancing your abilities further.

Immortal Physiques: Pure (Emperor's Domination)  
Cost: 20 SP  
With this power, you are bestowed with two divine physiques, each embodying the concept of Pure.

The first, The Void Imperfection Physique, renders you impervious and untouchable, be they offensive or defensive, prove futile against you. No harm can be inflicted upon your being, nor can any defense block your attacks, and ailments of any kind hold no power over you. Even the most potent of supernatural poisons or bewitching enchantments cannot affect you. As you progress toward Grand Completion, you transcend barriers and concepts themselves, attaining a state where nothing can touch you without your consent.

The second physique, The Soaring Immortal Physique, grants you unparalleled speed. Swift as a comet, your movements defy comprehension. Treasures and techniques pale in significance when faced with your incomprehensible velocity. At Grand Completion, your speed transcends even spatial confines, allowing you to traverse through any dimensional fabric. Your existence becomes a blur, causing spacetime itself to stand still in your presence.

Your journey starts with minor completion in both physiques, gradually advancing through dedicated training and experience. Over time, you will attain half completion, eventually culminating in grand completion—a state where you become the embodiment of Pure, an immortal being invulnerable to all harm and swifter than the fabric of reality itself.

Immortal Physiques: Taint (Emperor's Domination)  
Cost: 20 SP  
With this power, you acquire two distinct divine physiques, each embodying the concept of Taint. The first is The Hell Suppressing Immortal Physique—a physique of immeasurable heaviness. When you activate this physique, the weight of your body increases to astronomical levels. Even a single drop of your blood becomes as heavy as thousands of pounds. Attaining Grand Completion in this physique empowers you to perform feats of extraordinary might—crushing gods with a single stomp and bending reality itself under the weight of your presence. You become a walking cataclysm, leaving devastation in your wake.

The second physique, The Sky Destroyer Immortal Physique, grants you boundless strength. Activating this physique enables you to unleash infinite physical power. You can tear the mountains asunder with your bare hands, grapple with dragons on equal terms, and shatter divine artifacts and weapons with sheer physical force. At the pinnacle of your journey, when you attain Grand Completion in this physique, even abstract concepts, and divine laws yield before your overwhelming strength.

Your journey starts with minor completion in both physiques, gradually advancing through dedicated training and experience. Over time, you will attain half completion, eventually culminating in grand completion—a state where you become the embodiment of Taint, a force of indomitable weight and strength.

Immortal Physiques: Hardness (Emperor's Domination)  
Cost: 20 SP

The first is The Indestructible Diamond Immortal Physique—a form of invincibility. Even with a minor completion of this physique, you become impervious to conventional weapons and greatly resist all mystical attacks, but even the mightiest magic will be hard pressed to scratch you without divine power. At grand completion, not even Gods and Demons can break through your invulnerability.

The Indestructible Diamond Immortal Physique also grants unparalleled regenerative capabilities. Any injuries inflicted upon you are instantly healed, leaving no trace behind. When activated, your body emits a radiant, golden metallic glow, symbolizing your impenetrable nature.

The second physique is The Furious Immortal Tyrannical Physique. This physique enhances your vitality and unlocks your latent potential during battles, allowing your power to rapidly surge, and grow stronger to overwhelm your enemies. The extent of this boost depends on your untapped reserve, but each boost is also permanent, increasing your base stats with every battle, and amplifying your potential.

Your journey begins with a minor completion of both physiques, gradually advancing through dedicated training and experience. Over time, you will reach half-completion, and ultimately attain grand completion—a level of power turning you into the walking embodiment of the concept Hardness.

Immortal Physiques: Softness (Emperor's Domination)  
Cost: 20 SP  
With this power, you gain two divine physiques, each embodying the concept of Softness. The first is The Eternal Physique—a path that leads to a life unbounded by time. This physique grants no direct advantage in battles, but instead, it extends your lifespan to an extraordinary degree. Legends speak of those who complete the Eternal Physique achieving true immortality. While this claim remains unproven, user who attain Grand Completion can easily live for countless billions of years.

Growth of the Eternal Physique is a slow and solitary journey, akin to a snail's crawl. Progress is measured in generations, with each phase taking countless decades to master, and for most, even three generations barely marks the entry into this Physique's fundamental realm. To succeed, unwavering determination and an unyielding spirit are essential to resist the world's distractions.

Upon reaching Grand Completion, the flow of time itself is your plaything. Moments can be stretched into millennia, and a million years will pass in a blink of an eye, even eroding Gods and their realm to nothingness to the tides of time.

The second physique, The Sacred Spring Physique, blesses you with boundless vitality. Every technique fueled by this Physique exceeds normal limits, potentially becoming dozens or even hundreds of times more potent. Swiftness and force amplify every technique's might, granting it unparalleled speed and impact.

However, the crowning attribute of the Sacred Spring Physique is its inexhaustible stamina. On a battlefield, you may not be the most dominant force, but your resilience is unmatched.

Your journey starts with minor completion in both physiques, gradually advancing through dedicated training and experience. Over time, you will attain half completion, eventually culminating in grand completion—a state where you become the embodiment of Softness, a master of time and vitality.

From your very being, you can unleash a limitless torrent of sunfire and sunlight, wielding these scorching energies as weapons or tools. Additionally, the power to manipulate gravity resides within your grasp, permitting the creation of spatial rifts and the bending of cosmic forces to your will. As you attain grand completion, your presence becomes as unattainable as the sun high in the daytime sky, casting your brilliance upon all you survey.

The second physique, The Extreme Yang Immortal Physique, manifests as an indomitable sun that radiates from your chest. With it, you harness an unparalleled intensity of heat that can liquefy even the sturdiest of substances, and even space time. This blazing inferno can take on multiple forms, allowing you to unleash devastating attacks that incinerate all in your path. As you advance towards grand completion, not even abstract concepts can evade the all-consuming flames of your power.

Your journey starts with minor completion in both physiques, gradually advancing through dedicated training and experience.

Immortal Physiques: Yin (Emperor's Domination)  
Cost: 20 SP  
Harnessing divine essences, you now possess two divine physiques that embody the concepts of Yin.

Reincarnation (The God of High School)  
Cost: 60 SP  
You once held a position of extraordinary significance. In a previous existence, you were revered as one of the High Gods, an entity of immense power capable of reshaping the very foundations of this world. However, for reasons unknown, you perished or lost your divine abilities, only to be reborn as a child in your current race. Recently, you have begun to reawaken your dormant powers, as detailed below.

These powers and abilities, as well as any supernatural artifacts associated with them, can be accessed through a transformation into your godly form. Initially, this transformation will be draining, but with time and practice, you will extend its duration until it becomes a permanent state.

Your reincarnation bestows upon you several powers derived from your former self. Select a God, Monster, or other Mythological Figure from legends to serve as the basis of your original identity. Your powers and items will be modeled after this chosen entity.

Firstly, you inherit the physical prowess and life essence of a celestial being. Your strength allows you to obliterate entire worlds with a single strike, or hoist them above your head with some effort. Your speed surpasses that of light by a magnitude of at least a hundred thousand, and you possess the resilience to endure blows capable of shattering planets, akin to how humans withstand attacks from their fellow beings. Your life energy is so potent that a mere release of your power could submerge an entire world, and your life energy-based abilities are equally cataclysmic, capable of ending worlds as surely as your physical might.

Additionally, you acquire two distinctive and exceptional powers, as well as two unique items inspired by the legend of your original self. These items are comparable in potency to the fabled tools wielded by the Monkey King, such as Yeoui/Ryu Jingu Bang or Yongpyo. It is also possible to transform powers or remarkable feats associated with your chosen entity into original items, ensuring they remain rooted in their authentic legend.

Embrace your reborn divine nature and wield these newfound powers and artifacts, for you are destined to leave an indelible mark on the world that resonates with the echoes of your legendary past.

The Progenitor of Man (Records of Ragnarok)  
Cost: 40 SP  
You are the progenitor of mankind, the first human from which all of humanity has descended. Your love for humanity knows no bounds, and you are willing to face insurmountable odds to protect your children, even if it means battling the gods themselves. Your endurance is unimaginable, able to continue fighting for a short period after your body has died. Created in the image of a god, your beauty is even admired by beings like Aphrodite. Your reflexes are so impressive you are able to dodge punches that are faster than light. Your durability is remarkable as well, enabling you to withstand powerful blows from divine beings. Your charisma towards humans is immense, capable of touching their hearts and uniting them, if only temporarily. Regardless of the powers or strength you acquire, you will always retain the ability to assume a human form. For you are human.

As the first man, you were destined to rule over all Earth's animals. Most creatures will naturally be friendly towards you and may even lend you their aid. Additionally, you possess the Eyes of the Lord, which possess the ability of Divine Reflection. These eyes allow you to perfectly replicate any move or technique you witness. They even grant you temporary biological adaptations to accurately reproduce certain techniques. However, there are limitations to these eyes. They cannot replicate techniques dependent on external sources; they only work for different forms of inner power or energy. The strain of perceiving opponents' attacks puts a certain amount of pressure on your nervous system. Pushing your eyes to their limits causes your body to overheat, and further abuse risks rendering you blind, with bleeding occurring from your nose, eyes, and ears. Consequently, you lose the ability to use Divine Reflection.  
*The Body of Man*  
Required:The Emperor of Mankind (40k)

Furthermore, your offspring can inherit the powers you possess, provided you grant them permission. With sufficient concentration, you even have the ability to selectively decide which powers they will inherit.

However, through discipline and mastery, you can learn to control your powers without the need for multiple forms, and even attain new forms that greatly augment your base one, provided you are willing to expand the efforts to achieve such levels, though you can do so with relative ease.

In addition you have also gained telekinetic abilities, the ability to survive in space, regeneration, a highly resilient physique, and the capacity to paralyze your opponents by injecting a potent venom through retractable bone spurs concealed within your forearms.

Androids (Dragon Ball Series)  
Cost: 45 SP  
You have now become a robotic or cyborg human, whether a creation by a mad brilliant scientist in an underground laboratory or through a top-secret government project.

This energy sustains your physical capabilities indefinitely, surpassing the heat death of the universe and enduring beyond.

Martian Manhunter (DC Comics)  
Cost: 40 SP  
Your genes have been modified with green Martian DNA, and you have gained the associated powers.

Firstly, Martians possess shapeshifting capabilities on a molecular level, allowing them to alter themselves in ways almost unthinkable to less malleable species, such as causing their biopolymers to no longer reflect light, rendering them invisible. When trained, this can even extend to increasing or decreasing their relative density, letting them phase through objects. As a consequence, Martians also possess great regeneration, to the extent they can restore lost limbs in mere minutes, and rapidly slow their own ageing.

Physically, Martians are strong and durable enough to contend with Kryptonians, and easily shatter reinforced concrete. Similarly, they can both move and process thought at incredible speed.

Finally, Martians possess incredible psychic ability, being naturally telepathic and telekinetic, able to extend illusions, possessions, force blasts and telepathic assaults as easily as throwing a punch.  
As you are not a full blooded Martian, you do not possess the psychosomatic fear of fire implanted by the Guardians of the Universe  
Burner of Mars (DC Comics)  
Cost: 40 SP  
Required:Martian Manhunter (DC Comics)  
You’ve unlocked the ancestral secrets of Mars itself, and undone the manipulations of the accursed Guardians.

Secondly, Bio-fission, the ability to reproduce asexually, by splitting into a second, fully mature, Martian after feeding from the negative thoughts of others.

One of the Last Czarnians (DC Comics)  
Cost: 40 SP  
You are now one of the last Czarnians, and as a Czarnian, you are one of the most dangerous and nearly unkillable species in existence. This is because Czarnians possess natural physical abilities that are honestly astounding. Their strength and durability are able to physically match Martians, combat-focused New Gods, experienced Green Lanterns, and even yellow sun-empowered Kryptonians. They can casually lift 1 million tons, take planet-destroying attacks without a scratch, and their speed is such that they can combat speed Force users, react while traveling at massively FTL speeds across the universe, and sharpen their awareness while increasing their temporal flow.

One of the most well-known traits is the fact that they have truly inexhaustible stamina. They don't need any food, water, air, or sleep and can survive in the vacuum of space without any harm. Lobo has been known to "ride through the cold of space on his Space Hog and not notice the heat of blazing suns."

The senses of Czarnians are pretty interesting because their sense of smell is so strong that once they catch a scent just once, there is nowhere in the universe you can hide from them. One Czarnian has been known to track prey across intergalactic distances. They can even hear in space and possess a special sense that allows them to detect the weakest point in an opponent.

Czarnians tend to have either a general genius-level intellect or being super-genius in matters associated with destruction and violence. They craft unique weapons to kill prey and create complex virulent agents and the necessary antidotes to them, or making sentient "space vehicles" stuffed with all manner of weapons or semi-sentient weapons, creating all the technology necessary for a true utopia. They are also skilled at learning languages, with the most well-known example being Lobo, who has learned to speak 17,897 different languages from across the universe. You are able to choose between either the general genius in all categories or being smarter but Specialize in Violence and destruction.

The greatest trait of Czarnians that truly makes them one of the most dangerous species in the universe is their truly insane healing abilities. These abilities are so great that they are known throughout the universe to be biologically immortal unless facing another member of their race. Examples of how extreme their healing is include being immune to the effects of aging, disease, toxins, and poisons. They can regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue instantly, such as lost limbs or other body parts, with little apparent pain. They have even regenerated out of a pool of their own blood by recycling the cells instantly and controlling that same recycling of their cells whenever they feel like it to fight off foreign infections. One of their members could fight off a Black Light Infection from Black Lanterns. Czarnians reproduce through conventional means, but they can also reproduce asexually through replication caused by their regeneration. If you are wounded, any blood spilt may grow into a new Czarnian, sharing your memories and personality. So beware depending on your Personality you may have to fight your "Clones" if you are not careful.

Lastly, all Czarnians are characterized by having truly White Skin, Red Eyes Surrounded by a Black facial markings, and Wild but Fabulous Hair.

New Gods of the Fourth World (DC Comics)  
Cost: 45 SP  
You have become a New God. New Gods are beings that call themselves such (and certainly live up to the moniker) from the ashes of the Old Gods, and their close proximity to the Source, a primordial energy source behind the creation and “source” of all that exists in the DC Continuity, bestowing them phenomenal powers. Being a species with one of the highest technology bases, also contributed to their formidability through genetic stability and evolutionary perfection springing from their scientific base.

All New Gods are far stronger, faster, smarter, and tougher than an ordinary or most alien species, being functionally immortal and never aging past the age of 30, weathering the ravages of time; they can continue working or functioning at their best for days on end without feeling fatigued or needing sustenance; capable of shattering concrete and reinforced steel akin to glass, not to mention lifting and handling hundreds of tons with ease; any New Gods are durable to withstand most damage such blunt, piercing and slashing attacks or obstacles as feeling like little more than pebbles to your physical form, hell, the Empire State Building could fall on you and leave with bruises; and let’s not gloss over the health of a New God, with being a paragon of health, being immune to almost any disease from the Multiverse, rejecting both plagues, toxins, and parasites, among other abilities.  
Above all, you contest or nearly match the likes of a Kryptonian in physicality… that is when you match them in size. Let me restate it, size. A rarely discussed detail for natives in the Fourth World is that they’re larger than those of other universes, giants compared to mortals. Your ‘true’ size within the Fourth World would dwarf planets, matching grown stars in their enormity. It’s just the New Gods when traveling to destinations through their Boom Tubes, which adjust their sizes to a reasonable level, giving the illusion of commonality. You can change between your ‘normal’ size, ‘human’ size and anything in between through sheer act of will alone.

Another hardly known detail is that New Gods are also personifications of ideas, with the Fourth World acting as an archetypal world of Platonic Ideals i.e. Darkseid with Tyranny, Mister Miracle with Freedom, and Lightray with Joy; with you being no exception. You can choose whichever idea or concept you personify, which confers appropriate powers befitting the idea. This provides no other tangible benefit beyond an in-depth understanding of the said concept, allowing you to express it through your skills and deeds and learn things related to the said concept more quickly. The more broad it is, the less noticeable this benefit is.

With this in mind, even gods bleed. Sufficient force or power that outweighs your physical capabilities can wound even the likes of you, so your nature as God and natural durability are wrought low by Radion, the Kryptonite of your species. Good thing it’s hard to come by.

Finally, the New Gods are a species outside the space-time flow, preventing you from dimensional changes to yourself.

(Wo)Man of Steel (DC Comics)  
Cost: 40 SP

This can make you or anything you choose to affect, as infinitely heavier, tougher, denser and/or muscularly more robust. Using it on yourself causes an increase in size.  
The only drawback is that when you apply this power to increase your strength, you lose a bit of your invincibility and vice verse.

With enough power and mastery, you can create constructs made of the Strength Force energy and even compact mass to deform spacetime to form a blackhole.  
Your power can use Infinite Values in terms of Mass, Force and Gravity, meaning you can increased them infinitely, having this energy to be very catastrophic to spacetime if used irresponsibly. It also provides you the protection to function with unnatural mass, density and gravity without the laws of physics stopping you or destroying everything around.

Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist (One Punch Man)  
Cost: 10 SP  
Created by the S-Class Hero, Bang, this martial art stands as the ultimate defensive art that perfectly blends offense and defense. This art seeks to recreate the flows of torrential and undulating forces within one's body. Your mastery of this art reveals itself in the blue water-like aura that trails after your hands and other extremities. You have a perfect grasp of deflecting or redirecting an opponent's attack at twice the power. Your ability to redirect incoming attacks allows you to protect yourself from attacks that are notably more powerful than you are otherwise; however, even this feature of the art has its limits. Your initial mastery is comparable to Garou's and will grow to match and eventually eclipse even Bang's in time.  
*True Breathing*  
Required:Total Concentration Breathing (Demon Slayer)  
Required:Sendo (JJBA)  
The combination of Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist, Total concentration Breathing, and Hamon have reached a new level.  
Every breath you take empowers you to be slightly greater than you were before. Your physical capabilities are many times above what would previously be your maximum and can grow without limit. Any spiritual or mystical powers are likewise empowered with your every breath, with you having amazing reserves of energy and a seemingly supernatural talent. As you have complete awareness and control of your body, you will never lose balance and always be able to remain in fighting form.  
*Dual-Wielding Martial Arts*  
Required:Whirlwind Iron Cutting Fist (One Punch Man)  
Your mastery of Water Stream Rock Smashing Fist and Whirlwind Iron Cutting Fist has grown leaps and bounds allowing you to use them simultaneously. This combination is enough to allow you to fight any win over Dragon-level threats, or even greater. Combining these techniques, one in your left hand, and the other in your right, allows you to use the Roaring Aura Sky Ripping Fist technique. This technique sends incredible shockwaves through the body of the target, destroying them from within, and is capable of overcoming otherwise indomitable defenses. Pushing these martial arts further will allow use of the Cross Fang Dragon Slayer Fist, an even more potent combination technique.  
*Total Concentration Awakening Breathing*  
Required:Total Concentration Breathing (Demon Slayer)  
You have mastered the art of breathing. Specifically: completely and utterly saturating your body with oxygen, bringing out and leaving behind the normal limits of your body. Not only do your physical attributes attain a beyond-perfect state, but your thought processes and reaction times attain an equal level, allowing your mind to keep up with your body and keep pace with those who would normally fully outclass you. However, you should be warned: pushing your body to such an extreme burns through your stamina reserves at nearly an equal pace to your physical boost, leaving you vulnerable once the technique wears off.

Mister Negative (Marvel)  
Cost: 25 SP  
You have been experimented on with a dangerous new designer drug called D-Lite. Like the final test subject, you have gained the ability to generate and control both the Darkforce and Lightforce, unlike the previous two subjects, who only gained access to one or the other of the two forces.

Through the application of both energies, you could use them to varying effects. For instance, empowering yourself to greater degrees of durability, strength, and speed will let you be able to fight heroes like Spider-Man and trade blows with him relatively easily, even being able to send the Web-crawler flying through two buildings with but a single blow. You also possess the ability to project this energy outside your body, shooting out blasts of condensed Darkforce energy that look like black-and-white electrical energy.

Furthermore, by touching someone, you can imbue them with Lightforce energy, healing them from any disease or illness. You are also able to endow them with varying levels of durability, strength, and speed, similar to what you possess. With Darkforce energy, you can corrupt those you touch, altering their personalities and morals to be more evil or immoral. This brings out the evil in people's hearts, even if they have none, and amplifies it until they are subservient to your interests. This ability is more effective the more morally good a person was before they were corrupted.

With time, you could find a variety of new uses for the Darkforce and Lightforce, able to do more than what you could when you started with this power. Examples such as creating a symbiote from the remaining enzymes in a previous host are just the tip of the iceberg. Your power grows with the more negative emotions you feel or absorb from others.

Unlike the original Mister Negative, these powers don’t create a new persona.

Avatar of Cyttorak (Marvel)  
Cost: 40 SP  
This ancient jewel, powered by Cyttorak, the ruler of the Crimson Cosmos, binds to the user's soul and transforms them into the unstoppable Juggernaut.  
Usually, Cyttorak, as a bid of the Wager of the Octessence, would choose an Avatar through his Crimson Gem, binding their Soul to him to be his agent back on Earth.

Not this time, Cyttorak saw something within you that, at least, pleased him to offer you his Avatar's blessing, with his power enveloping you, turning you into his Exemplar: The Juggernaut, a nearly unstoppable force of nature. The Juggernaut boasts of near-limitless strength, stamina, and durability, granting exorbitant levels of invulnerability, enough to go toe to toe with a moderately angry Green Scar or the Mighty Thor, evenly fighting to a draw along a winning chance.

You are completely self-sustained as Cyttorak’s Avatar, finding air, sustenance, or sleep unnecessary, while also having an immunity to contaminants of any kind. The self-perpetuating mystical energies endowed by your Patron cover all your needs, a perpetual motion lifeform by any other name.

When it comes to boons, a personal force field you can control and extend, also bolster your already physical ability, more so your durability. A field strong enough to withstand attacks like Thor’s God Blast, Adamantium-made weapons, or the very presence of Oblivion himself, leaving you completely unscathed. It can also absorb and redirect energetic attacks. With enough power borne from favor, one can levitate to, dare I say, fly. Should your force field and immense durability meet their match for you to be injured, your regenerative healing factor comes to the rescue, healing at an accelerated rate from wounds on the level of being utterly flayed down to a skeleton.

For convenience’s sake, Cyttorak has also given you the ability to alter your size between a normal human to being 80ft tall mountain of a person.

The greatest power bestowed by Cyttorak’s great glory truly fitting of the name Juggernaut is that you come to be the embodiment of an Irresistible Force. The moment you advance in a certain direction, it is virtually impossible to halt your movement unless you want to. While it is possible to slow you down, unless it requires an attack on the scale of Thor’s God Blast, you won’t be stopped.

As a consequence of being an Avatar, you gain immortality from “natural” means not enough to overcome the power of the Crimson Cosmos.

Your single weak spot is your mind, which fortunately your armor suit from the Crimson Cosmos shields against almost all psychic attacks, being comparatively durable as you. Please bear in mind your enemies can and will remove your helmet–while no easy feat, is on the table if you’re careless.

Note that you still have the difficulties and complications borne from hosting an extradimensional god of destruction, though they are lessened by Cyttorak’s personal “liking” of you.

Asgardian (Marvel)  
Cost: 20 SP  
You gain the physiology of an Asgardian. You will have superhuman physical abilities as well as an unlimited lifespan. You gain the Allspeak, the universal language that can be understood by all.  
Royal Blood (Marvel)  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:Asgardian (Marvel)  
The Blood of Asgard's greatest Gods runs through you. You gain even greater physical attributes and the choice of a divine domain, like Wisdom, War, Thunder, Storm, and so on. Your potential becomes equal to the greatest in Asgardian history, such as Odin and Rune King Thor.  
*The Power of Thor*  
Required:Mjolnir (Marvel)  
You have been given the powers and blood of Marvel 616-Thor, awakening his Domains of Storms, Strength, War, and so on... But this also changes your blood from just a Royal Asgardian to an Elder God Hybrid, as Thor is the child of the Elder Goddess Gaea, giving you the potential to perform feats surpassing all other Gods \- for you are not a mere God, but Elder. As a child of Gaea, this allows your very blood to bring life to the Earth, and draw strength from it while in its Domain. Optionally, you may gain memories of Thor and his other equipment, such as his Belt that Doubles his Strength, durability and power or his Axe Jarnbjorn, or any other item that he has collected over the years. If you so choose you can also call upon Thor's trusty Animal-God companions Toothgnasher and Toothgrinder  
*The Power of Loki*  
Required:Master of the Mystic Arts (Marvel)  
You have been given the powers and blood of Marvel 616-Loki, The Trickster god, awakening his domains of mischief, Evil, Lies, and so on. The Wizard of Lies: While you still keep your abilities as an Asgardian, you are no longer one; instead, you are half Frost Giant. This further increases your talent with magic so that you have less trouble producing spells with Magicbabble, the Mystic Arts, or just magic in general, with a peculiarly superior aptitude for spells that lie in Illusions, Enchantment, and ice manipulation. Optionally, you may gain memories of Loki and his other equipment, such as his scepter or any other item that he has collected over the years. If you so choose you can also call upon Loki's animal companions such as Fenrir or Jormungand.  
*Thor (ᚦᛟᚾᚨᚱ)*  
Required:Mjolnir (Marvel)  
Required:Mjölnir (God of War)  
You have the power of Thor (ᚦᛟᚾᚨᚱ), the berserker and god of Strength, Thunder, lightning, and other domains. You have the might to smash mountains and lift Jörmungandr, the world serpent, drink enough water to lower the water of the world by a substantial amount, and give a fair fight to the personification of age. However, you don't only gain the powers of the Thor known to the world through Norse Myth; you also gain the powers of every interpretation of Thor. Additionally, this does not only affect you, as both Mjolnir are affected, bringing them back to what Mjolnir should have originally been if not for Loki messing with the dwarfs in a bid to not get his head removed from his body. This changes Mjolnir so that it is three times as strong, as well as combining them into a war hammer. You can also transform them back into their separate forms to dual-wield, although this lowers the boost to only being two times as strong as normal.

Gamma Mutate (Marvel)  
Cost: 30 SP  
Much like Bruce Banner, you are now host to a rage-fueled alter ego. Stress or injury will cause you to transform into a Hulking, irradiated brute. In this form, you possess massive super strength, durability, stamina, regeneration, speed, and resistance. In combat, all of these abilities scale higher as your rage grows, though you will eventually hit a soft cap. When transformed your looks are two levels below your standard appearance.  
*Burning Hulk*  
Required:King of Monsters (Godzilla Franchise)  
Your G-Cells have enhanced your Gamma Transformation. You are no longer limited to radiation, now capable of absorbing any form of energy, including the Power Cosmic and other higher-tier energies.

Additionally, the angrier you become, the more heat your body emits—similar to the Red Hulk. At peak levels of rage, the heat you produce can rival the intensity of a nuclear explosion. Unlike the Red Hulk, you won’t suffer from burnout while generating this immense energy.

Moreover, your G-Cells continuously adapt to the strain caused by your energy absorption. Over time, this adaptation will allow you to handle increasingly larger amounts of power, pushing your limits further than ever before.  
World Breaker (Marvel)  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Gamma Mutate (Marvel)  
Your rage empowerment is no longer soft-capped, and you will scale much faster.  
Immortal Hulk (Marvel)  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Gamma Mutate (Marvel)  
You become an Immortal Hulk, a being linked to the "One Below All", as such, your powers grow stronger at nighttime and in dark places. This powers grants you various abilities, such as perceiving lies, self-sustenance, communicate with ethereal beings (such as spirits), detect gamma radiation, awareness about if you are being monitored, manipulate your body and even the power to absorb energies, gamma radiation, beings inside you and magic.  
The most remarkable feature of this upgrade is that it grants you complete and total control over the "Green Door", which is what grants you, your immortality.  
You can't ever be truly killed, because you will always come back.  
Gamma Beast  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:World Breaker (Marvel)  
Required:Fel Blood (Warcraft)  
Your Gamma form is infused by the Fel, removing any concern for diminishing returns and physically empowering you even further. This also provides a massive level of magic resistance.

Homo Immortalis (Marvel)  
Cost: 40 SP  
You have now become an Eternal. Eternals are an evolutionary offshoot of humanity called Homo immortalis. This branch of humanity was created by the Celestials to be at the absolute peak of what humanity could achieve evolutionarily. They were then gifted and infused with Cosmic Energy, which gave them great powers and abilities to look after the human race throughout the ages.

As an Eternal, you are immortal and are immune to things like toxins, diseases, age etc., and have a healing ability that, should you be injured somehow, you could regenerate any injured or missing tissue as long as a significant portion of your body's molecules are not dispersed.

At your baseline with no cosmic energy, your physical capabilities are such that your strength is a match for a peak-condition Spider-Man, Luke Cage, and such. Your agility, reactions, movement, and running speeds are such that you can dodge light. Your durability is where you shine in that you can take hits from an un-angry Hulk, Hercules, and an unworthy Thor and keep on going for a few days. Your intelligence is so great that you can come up with technology millennia in advance of the modern day or pick up and master new skills in days to weeks. Your senses are superhuman, allowing you to hear in a few city blocks, smell like the greatest animals of Earth, see everything for 1 mile, etc.

And all this is without the greatest gift of the Celestials to the Eternals, Cosmic Energy, the energy of the Universe itself. With this gift, your true potential as an Eternal is realized. You can enhance all your physical abilities such that your strength can allow you to throw hands with an angry Hulk, a worthy Thor, Hercules with his godhood, and actually harm them, and if you're smart, defeat them. Your agility is such that you now view light as standing still and can fly the cosmos under your own power by manipulating gravitons around yourself. Your durability matches your strength in that it takes hits from an angry Hulk and a worthy Thor to make you bleed. Your life force is augmented by Cosmic energy, bolstering your metabolism so that you no longer get tired from any physical exertion, need to breathe, and can travel space without any equipment. Your intelligence has been enhanced such that you are capable of interpreting DNA code at a glance, accurately enough to determine parentage. You have basic cosmic awareness with a range as big as a planet, have perfect memory and indexing, such that memories are to you as 'real' as the present, with your most vivid memory dominating your perceptions. Your senses are now godly, allowing you to see through solid objects, the entire electromagnetic spectrum, telescopic vision to see objects in clear detail at long distances, even minuscule things like strands of DNA while in orbit casually, and with a bit of focus, down to the microscopic level.

This is only the basics of what cosmic energy unlocked for you. It also gave you telekinesis/molecular manipulation that at its peak can create whole ships from the molecules around you or create inviolable shields that can last for hours, telepathy to read and even manipulate the minds of others, illusions, teleportation, and the ability to manipulate cosmic energy in the form of beams from your eyes or beams, flashes, and blasts from your hands as various types of energy (gravity, various electromagnetic, quantum, etc.).

As of right now, you can only enhance yourself with the energy and do the bare basics of the above skills, like reading minds of those close by, or moving objects around a room and shooting basic cosmic energy beams from your eyes and hands. So you are given a database in your head on how to train your abilities to the highest levels that an Eternal can reach.

Homo Superior (Marvel)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Your X-Gene is activated and your latent mutant powers awaken. The powers you gain from this are up to you, but must be Alpha level and you will be able to train them through practice. You are guaranteed to not be physically mutated in an unappealing way.  
Rogue (Marvel)  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:Homo Superior (Marvel)  
You gain every Alpha level or below power. This doesn't change your physical appearance unless you wish it to.  
Omega-Level Mutant (Marvel)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:Homo Superior (Marvel)  
You may have the Omega level ability of your choice, except for Franklin Richards & Nate Grey.  
*Anointed Prince(ss)*  
Required:Champion of the World Eater (Marvel)  
You’ve been ennobled with a great Fate. The circumstances of your existence have led to an event where you’ll be entrusted with a role in the next iteration of the Universe, inheriting from a previous being. Meanwhile, you’ve gained a power comparable to Beyond Omega-Level Mutants such as Franklin Richards, Nathaniel Grey, or Matthew Malloy and/or the abilities of Galactus and Moridun in terms of the Power Cosmic once you take up the mantle and merge with the Sentience of the Cosmos (or an equivalent in any place you end up in).  
At first, a spark or drop of this power will be available to you, and with time it’ll trickle and be stocked the closer you are to the destined end of the Universe.  
Mister Sinister (Marvel)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:Homo Superior (Marvel)  
You aren't satisfied with being a mere mutant, you find it far too limited for your ambitions.

You have become capable of recreating any technology prominently featured or implied to be available in the X-Men series and its spinoffs (X-Force, X-Factor, New Mutants, Excalibur, Marauders, etc.), but this is only the start of your power. You are now an unparalleled genius with regards to biology and other related fields, particularly genetics. You are even capable of altering the X-Gene itself, allowing you to research and give yourself or others Mutant powers.

Mutation is a blank canvas to you, and you its finest artist. If you wish for more Omega level powers, build them. If you wish to advance mankind into a new species, do so. If you wanted to build Sentinels, you could. Your potential is unlimited, but it is up to you to seize it.  
*A Suit of Sinisters*  
Required:Mother Righteous (Marvel)  
Required:Doctor Stasis (Marvel Comics)  
Required:Orbis Stellaris (Marvel Comics)  
With mastery of the biological, the magical, the posthuman, of earth and beyond, you've begun to take your first steps into being a Dominion. A great interstellar intelligence unrivaled in strength and aptitude. To many, it can be considered borderline omnipotent. Once you achieve this rank, you will exist outside of time and space, and will always have existed beyond it.

It may take years, decades, centuries or millennia, but with such a depth and breadth of knowledge at your hands, such a pace will be a small price to pay. Your biomechanical ascension will not be stayed, reaching evolutionary infinity and technological omnipotence. When you achieve it, it will be your crown and scepter. Walk the path you know, realise your potential, and seize infinity.  
*Astonishing Tech: Three Aces of a Kind*  
Required:Doctor Stasis (Marvel Comics)  
Required:Orbis Stellaris (Marvel Comics)  
Your technological and intellectual mutant acumen has transcended the boundaries of what’s possible, gaining access to the scientific and applied understanding from Marvel Multiverse in your efforts to amass the entirety of theoretical knowledge necessary to accomplish your transformation into a Dominion, but a mystical missing piece leaves you naught with a Titan’s equivalent of possible knowledge. If it’s any consolation, your knowledge encompasses the comprehensive archive of cutting-edge inventions and projects from both terrestrial and galactic civilizations existing across the Marvel Multiverse, including iterations of similar projects to comparatively improve or culminate them.

From the prospect of technological endeavours bordering on fantastical in the case of Kang’s temporal technology, and scientific potential from the likes of the Kree, the Shi’ar, Galactus, The Stranger, High Evolutionary, the Technarchy/Phalanx, the Entity on the Moon’s Nubotechnology, the Celestials, etc. This might be enough to halve the process of your metamorphosis into a Dominion by a great amount if you wish to complete your final magical journey.  
Legion (Marvel)  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Rogue (Marvel)  
Required:Omega-Level Mutant (Marvel)  
You have now acquired an additional similar mutant power to Legion, an Omega-level mutant with the power to induce spontaneous mutations within himself and so manifest new mutant powers.

Your version of this Omega-level ability is far more controlled than Legion's as you can gain powers as you wish. The caveat of this is that the stronger and more specific the power desired, the longer the time needed to manifest it. A completely random low-level mutant power would take under an hour, while a specific Omega-level ability could take multiple months to manifest.

You lack the alternative personalities present within Legion, but the process of generating powers is noticeably mentally taxing; if you carelessly produce dozens of random low-level mutations or formidable detailed powers without taking your time to acclimatise to them, this can lead to symptoms such as hallucinations, psychosis or worse.

Your powers cannot exceed Omega-level in strength, but otherwise, there are almost no limits to the powers you can acquire. No power you manifest will negatively affect your existence or possess significant drawbacks.

### Mental and Psychic

Music Meister (DC Comics)  
Cost: 10 SP  
You now possess the ability to reach and utilize the very same pitch found by Darius Chapel, also known as the Music Meister, the Maestro of Villainy. This pitch is hypnotic in nature, allowing those who hear it to fall into a trance that will follow your every word (and optionally sing and dance along with you while doing so\!). As it is now, you can only use this pitch when singing, not when speaking. This is kept up indefinitely until either one of four things happen:

First, is that you manually cut off the connection, which you can do at any time you wish. Secondly, is (in the case that you’re using a medium to increase your range) if the medium you’re using, like a microphone or satellite, is destroyed or disconnected. In this way, anyone who can still hear you normally will still be hypnotized, provided that you are still singing. If not, then they’ll also be knocked out of the trance. Third, is if they’re knocked unconscious. Finally, if those hypnotized by you don’t hear you sing after half an hour since they last heard you, then they will naturally fall out of the trance.

You can command your minions by giving out orders in between verses, or singing them out in your songs. Either way, they will follow the spirit of your words, rather than the letter, in the case that the orders are broad or simple. If it’s something more complicated, then they will need you to explain properly. You do not need to sing out every order, but their performance does increase if you do so.

To complement this, you also have an uncanny talent for improvising songs on the fly, able to create catchy tunes even in off putting situations, or when you are caught off-guard. Good guys or bad guys, none of that really matters when all become minions to your hypnotic patter.  
*This Booming Voice*  
Required:Shaker/Master (Speaker)  
With your peculiar ability to alter and project your voice, you can now utilize the hypnotic pitch with your voice any time you wish, even outside of singing. From giving your serious tone some extra power to further intimidate foes, or using it to increase the effectiveness of your attempts to make a lasting first impression.  
*The World is Mine*  
Required:Magical Melody  
For someone like you, who has not only found a way to control all listening to your voice, but also having been blessed by music itself, now nothing is out of your reach. With your ability to evoke any concept, feeling, idea, etc. as a musical piece, you can now use this as a method to order those you control around without needing to spell it out for them. No matter how simple or complicated it may be, you will always find a way to translate it into a musical masterpiece. The voices of your minions will fit your songs perfectly, to the point where even tone deaf people will have no problems singing along with you or going off key at any point.

Furthermore, with your ability to conjure any instruments you require, you can conjure objects that can project your voice further than it could’ve on its own, such as microphones and speakers. With this alone, you could theoretically control an entire city with your voice, provided that you’re in just the right place for everyone to hear you. The sound of any instrument that you conjure also carries the hypnotic pitch, and as such, can act as a substitute for your voice.

The Silence (Doctor Who)  
Cost: 30 SP  
You have the ability to erase all memory of your existence the moment someone looks away from you, using post-hypnotic suggestions. This ability applies to all ways a person can be viewed, even a photograph. When a person reestablishes sight upon you, they remember all past interactions with you, until they stop looking at you once again.

You can issue commands to any person looking at you, that will remain after they look away, acting as a post-hypnotic suggestion. This extends to any instruction issued while a subject is looking at you, including a picture of you will cause this effect.

Additionally, you can absorb electricity, even the smallest amount of static electricity from the air into your body, increase the voltage a hundred-fold, and fire it from your hands. These energy discharges are strong enough to obliterate a person instantly.

You are impervious to some types of scanning devices, though particularly esoteric devices, and clever algorithms can overcome this protection.

While any species that looks upon you will forget when they look away, they can still hear you. Additionally, mundane methods, such as tally marks, can be used to note an encounter with you.

Disastrous Life (The Disastrous Life of Saiki K)  
Cost: 60 SP  
Why would you want this? Even the character this is based on would rather not have his powers.

You have been cursed with the gift of psychic powers; you are what psychics are to normal humans. While the normal psychic is limited to only one manifestation of mental abilities, you are more advanced than the average psychic. Similar to Saiki Kusuo, you have a vast array of psychic abilities that grow with you as you gain more abilities the longer that you exist. The might of your psychic powers grows in a similar fashion to Saiki's, growing with no upper limit at a rapid pace.

Your list of powers includes but is not limited to teleportation around the world, so long as you know the location that you have seen before. This would allow you to teleport to a location if you looked at a photograph, astral projection, leaving behind your mortal vessel. Possession into the body of someone else, pulling objects of equal value, transferring them between locations, The ability to duplicate yourself into multiple bodies, but the more you do so, the less the clones start to look similar to yourself and grow weaker with each additional copy, as well as sharing the pain between all versions of yourself; the ability of clairvoyance; cryokinesis; the ability to curse others with misfortune or death; electrokinesis; flight; hydrokinesis; hypnosis; invisibility; memory alteration; mind control on a planetary scale; the ability to turn others into stone by looking them in the eye; precognition; However, this brings debilitating headaches, telepathy, x-ray vision, and more abilities the longer that you continue to use them. With enough time, you could learn to copy the abilities of others through psychic might.

You also gain a pair of limiters that allow you to turn off your powers.

Sage Force Conduit (DC Comics)  
Cost: 40 SP  
You have merged with the Sage Force, one of the fundamental forces of reality like the Speed Force and Emotional Spectrum. Just like how the original Apes of the Gorilla city were evolved from the touch of Sage Force, your psyche and body also have evolved beyond your initial limitations. This has enhanced your intellect beyond that of geniuses and granted you various psychic powers. Your psychic powers range from telepathy, clairvoyance, illusion projection and telekinesis to even teleportation. You are able to create a mental world of your own where you can trap the psyche of others for eternity. You can manipulate this mental world as you see fit. This also allows you to preserve your memories from various timeline changes. This power also synergies well with technology and allows you to create technology to bring your thoughts to life, teleport large distances, make an entire city fall under illusion, and various other phenomenon. With time and effort, you may further discover new abilities.

Luthorism Mindset (DC Comics)  
Cost: 60 SP  
You have now become the world premiere super-genius, possessing a 12th level intellect equivalent to Lex Luthor and Brainiac. You can seamlessly hold and process 12 simultaneous thoughts, granting you the ability to innovate and advance any fields you take interest in, solving even the most complex problems with ease.

Moreover, your intellect has a compounding effect, as aligning your thoughts on a single subject multiplies your cognitive abilities exponentially. For instance, focusing two of your thoughts on the economy would make you 144 times more effective in devising solutions and crafting economic systems. Concentrating all 12 of your thoughts on a single subject results in a remarkable enhancement, making you more effective by a staggering 12^12 times. This level of concentration would essentially render you nearly omniscient in regards to that subject matter.  
*Marvelous Super-Genius*  
Required:Mankind Redefined (Marvel)  
Your evolution reaches your mental prowess compounding with your already astonishing intelligence. You gained both cognitive traits and intuitive talents from the smartest people in the Marvel Universe, with Amadeus Cho’s ability to process and correlate boggling amounts of information, innate talents in fields of biology, genetics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, all manner of branches of physics, tactical and strategic acumen, an eclectic proclivity to techno-mystical avenues of knowledge, etc., all to name a few from the likes of the Illuminati, the Intelligencia, among many others.

It is both a repository of potential knowledge as it is the next step in a human’s road to mental illumination.

A Spark of Genius (Girl Genius)  
Cost: 20 SP  
The Spark is plugged into your mind and soul, inflaming it, filling it with a fire that boosts your mental facilities to unbelievable extents such that many things that should be impossible... suddenly aren't.  
While you specialize in some field to extraordinary degrees, like being able to create artificial sparks if you choose 'Von Neumann Clanks', your genius is unbound by the petty concerns lesser sparks suffer from, allowing you to shine equally bright in every field from Microbiology to Trans-Dimensional Aeronautics.

You have an instinctive grasp for scientific principles, can reverse engineer technology more or less just from seeing it, and have a head for calculation and numbers that defies belief. You can decrypt data in your head, have a completely flawless memory, and are in general the quintessential Mad Scientist. Complete with a gift for cackling and rants that can terrify anyone who isn't, by the way.

When in the Madness Place, especially, you have an outright effect that allows you to warp time and space in a small area around you, letting you do weeks' worth of work in hours, and outright warp, twist, spindle the mutilate the very laws of physics as you craft your wonders... and horrors. Apart from the SCIENCE\!, you have a charisma that borders on mind control, as anyone without a spark or an exceptionally strong willpower is drawn into your orbit by your sheer force of will, ready to help and serve wherever they can. Your body is also somewhat better than most, allowing you to go all those all-nighters without food and fight off highly trained fighters while barely paying attention.  
Second Breakthrough (Girl Genius)  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:A Spark of Genius (Girl Genius)  
Your talents with the sparks cross the basic boundaries all the way, transforming you into something altogether beyond. You have had the second breakthrough, the transformation that makes you from a Spark into true Spark Royalty\!

You're not a fully grown, matured God-Spark quite yet, but you’re well on your way to becoming one. Along with having psychic powers like levitation and telepathy, you can release blasts of pure energy to scour your foes from the earth. You can see in more than three dimensions, and even interact with beings beyond the mortal plane in several ways. You have the power to shapeshift freely, going from giant to normal in an instant, and acquiring any color, appearance or form you desire.

You can possess willing subjects, and break any mind control or subversion on your subjects. You can control energy in various forms, most of them rather unspecified. Most importantly, of course, your talents with actual Sparking transcend any ordinary sparks entirely, being almost as much beyond them as they are beyond mundane scientists. You have a surfeit of ideas, almost as if you can do anything\!

You don't even need to bother with Madness Places very much anymore, that is, being 'Suspended in an Eternal Moment of Supreme Clarity'. You do retain your ability to scare lesser minds out of their skin just by talking. Oh, and you gain a rotating halo of any symbols of your choice, turning around your head in an endless circle. You can hide the obvious bits of this, but why would you want to?

Sha Naqba Imuru (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 35 SP  
You gain a sense of clairvoyance several levels above most others, a continuous active ability (though you can suppress it,) which gives information on everything around you, seemingly to the point of omniscience. You can discern truths and information about almost anything you see and even what you don’t see. As you are like Gilgamesh, spread across all corners of the world like the brilliance of the stars, seeing through all creation.  
When facing you in a game like chess, even someone making advanced predictions and reading the flow of the game will have already lost at that moment. You do not read the future of the chess board, but instead gazes down upon and oversee it, allowing the correct move to always be visible to you. Even in something like a card game, the very minimum requirement to play against you on equal terms would be to draw the precise hand required at all times. You can also see the possibilities of various parallel worlds should you so choose. Your future sight sees all, clearly and without fail even up until the very death of the universe.

### Mystic and Magic

Heir of the Old Ones (Warhammer Fantasy)  
Cost: 35 SP  
Required:First Generation Slann (Warhammer Fantasy)  
Instead of a Slann, you are on par with their makers, the Old Ones themselves. This boosts your personal power even further, with spells like the Vortex being but child’s play to you, and moving planets a simple and only mildly difficult struggle. This also grants you intelligence on par with an Old One. You possess powers beyond that of a god, and could indeed bind and shape them to your will just as you could beings of flesh and blood. The mere act of speaking is enough to slay any being weaker than a First Generation Slann Mage-Priest, should you wish it.

Your mastery of magic and technology is where you truly shine however, for yours built an empire so grand it spans the universe itself and all of time. Entire races of servants might be built to fulfill your grand designs, and you know how to make gates going through the Aethyr that allows for instant travel between two places. Indeed magic and technology are but one and the same to you. Your mastery of biology is not merely limited to servant races either, indeed for your kind molded from subpar materials the many races of Mallus, primarily Elves, Dwarves, and Humans.  
*Survivor of the War in Heaven (40k)*  
Required:Psyker (40k)  
Your psychic potential has unlocked your hidden potential as an Old One. No longer are you limited to simply being an Old One of the Fantasy universe, but instead, you have grown to match the Old Ones of the Warhammer 40K universe. The Old Ones are perhaps one of the oldest races in existence. Having created many, if not all, of the species within the galaxy.

Your biological knowledge has expanded to include the various races of the 40k universe that the Old Ones had a hand in creating or uplifting, granting you the ability to manufacture intelligent lifeforms of war such as the Krorks.

Along with this advanced biological knowledge the various psychic technologies that the Old Ones had a hand in creating, such as the Webway, a galactic teleportation network, and more. Your abilities as a Psyker have been enhanced as an Old One, being more controlled and less unstable, along with being generally more powerful than a human or Eldar Psyker could ever hope to achieve at the same grade.

Phenomenal Evil (League of Legends)  
Cost: 30 SP  
Having mantled the legacy of Veigar, the Tiny Master of Evil, you are now following in his footsteps to becoming the most evil villain ever\!

His legacy grants you a multitude of physical and magical benefits. Such that you are now a spiritual being akin to a yordle in essence, unable to be permanently killed by normal means, and aging incredibly slowly. You also gain Veigar’s mental repository of all his Runterran spiritual, elemental, celestial, and primordial magic. His knowledge of these arts allow him access to many spells and abilities, such as throwing bolts of dark energy, trapping foes within the timeless infinites between moments, summoning meteors of dark matter from the sky, and even recreating primordial bursts of destruction through the combination of multiple magics.

However, the crown ability of Veigar that makes him such a force of nature, is his innate ability of Phenomenal Evil, which permanently increases your raw magical potency whenever you hit an enemy with any of your spells or abilities.

Logomancy (DC Comics)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Logomancy, also known as "backwards magic", is a type of Order Magic that allows the user to create supernatural effects by speaking backwards.

You can do almost anything with Logomancy like manipulating the weather, traveling through dimensions, flying, or healing and even resurrecting people or animals.

As an Order Magic, Logomancy takes a toll on the user. The more complicate and powerful the effect, the higher the cost, going from a negligible cost to an insufferable pain that can kill you. With more practice and experience you can reduce the cost of the spells.  
*Enunciatic Evocation*  
Required:Enuncia (40k)  
You have brought the reality-warping forces of magic and Enuncia together, enriching your command over creation itself. Now, instead of needing to speak, you can also use Logomancy by writing words backwards such as "llaberif" for a fireball.

What gets really interesting is when you speak or write Enuncia backwards via Logomancy. The combination of using Enuncia with Logomancy results in a multiplicative effect wherein it causes spells cast to become exponentially more powerful. A spell that might normally only affect a large city could instead impact an entire country when using Enuncia.

You won't receive any more backlash from the spell than what you would typically receive if you were casting an unaltered version. However, these spells are extremely difficult to speak or write, meaning that careful preparation and learning are needed. These restrictions will ease with practice and eventually your spells will become something truly earth-shattering.

Ice King (Adventure Time)  
Cost: 25 SP  
Long before the mushroom war, there existed an ice elemental of great renown, Urgence Evergreen. He and the other elementals discovered that a comet filled with evil magic was headed to the planet, and in order to stop the comet, they created a crown, a crow filled with magic that could grant the wearer's innermost wish. Sadly, before he could use the crown to save the world, he got stuck under a block of ice and was forced to ask his student Gunther to wear the crown and save the world Urgence Evergreen, however, did not anticipate that Gunther's deepest desire would not be to save the world but to be just like Urgence Evergreen. Like Gunther, you have gained abilities similar in nature to Urgence Evergreen. Just without the sacrifice of sanity that comes with wearing the crown and being transformed into a different person.

You have gained unparalleled control over the field of ice magic, being able to freeze both living and non-living creatures into ice, transform ice into creatures, or use the ice to make weapons. You can also call storms of snow and ice or even shoot bolts of ice lightning from your hands. You also have access to a plethora of other abilities, such as flight, withstanding intense temperatures, seeing things beyond the ordinary, a sixth sense that could alert you to danger and protect you while not conscious, invisibility, illusion creation, and so much more.

While you are not limited to simply using ice magic, using other magic takes more time and effort than using ice magic. Your current strength in magic is enough to level a small country and will only grow as you get older, and with immortality, you have eternity to study and practice magic and grow in strength.

Warlic (Artix entertainment)  
Cost: 25 SP  
You possess a remarkable magical anomaly: instead of depleting your internal magical reserves when you use magic, you generate more magical power within yourself.

This gives you access to an essentially limitless source of magic, enabling exponential growth as each spell amplifies your magical abilities proportionally to its cost.

However, there's a crucial caveat: the human body has limits in containing magical energy. Overuse could lead to a catastrophic explosion, as your body may burst like an overinflated balloon due to the immense pressure of the magic you generate. It's essential to give your body time to adapt to its heightened magical baseline before casting spells again.

With enough time or a sufficient number of spells, you could potentially reach a level of magical prowess comparable to that of a deity.

Furthermore, you've gained some knowledge about elemental magic from the planet Lore.

The Dark One (Once Upon a Time)  
Cost: 30 SP  
You have become the 25th Dark One, one of the few individuals who have hosted the Darkness, a dark magical entity. You are also granted the knowledge and skills of all the previous Dark Ones.

Being the Dark One grants you immortality, such that you no longer age and don't need sleep (though most Dark Ones find a hobby to pass the time, like spinning gold from straw or making dreamcatchers). You are not affected by temperature or most dark magic. You can regenerate from any wound not inflicted by the Sword of the Dark One. If you die by means other than the Sword of the Dark One or a being of much greater power, you will reform in the "Vault of the Dark One", The ability to generate and control darkness is another gift of being the Dark One. Additionally, you have a great affinity for magic in all its forms except Seer, Divine, and Fairy magic (though these limits can be bypassed if you are clever at making deals or finding loopholes).

Your magic can be used for teleportation, age manipulation, telekinesis, elemental control, energy blasts, healing, enhancing your physical abilities, potioncraft, alchemy, summoning objects or individuals, planar/dimensional travel, technopathy, metaphysical heart extraction and control, and more. This branch of magic is only limited by a few laws, such as raising the dead (creating an alternative reality instead), creating love (only an illusion of love, not the real thing), and time travel (the attempt will create an alternative reality instead of actually travelling to the past). all your magics can be enhanced by your emotions

As the Dark One, with the knowledge and experiences of your predecessors, you are a grandmaster at making magical deals, bargains, etc., with individuals to grant their deepest wishes and darkest desires. These deals can be made for objects like gold or lessons in a skill, or something as esoteric as someone's power, love, knowledge, etc. The possibilities of these deals are only limited by your ingenuity and cleverness, and they don't have to be "fair" deals.

You have a few weaknesses: the Sword of the Dark One, which can kill you (if someone does this, they will become the new Dark One), being in a realm where magic can't exist, and items enchanted to block magic.

Last but not least, you possess the Sword of the Dark One, also known as Excalibur, which can cut magic and kill immortals by cutting their immortality. With a ritual, you can turn it back into the Holy Grail which when drunk from, grants immortality and great magic power.  
Note: You do not have to worry about the corruption of the Darkness leading to your death or your morals and looks being twisted by being the Dark One.

Formulaic Magic (DxD)  
Cost: 10 SP  
The power of numbers: you have gained the magic system the humans use in DxD. Through the power of research and calculation, you are able to emulate the power of devils. Though the devils can bring about their vision of reality through pure imagination and will, yours is different in that it takes study and equations. Through this magic, you can wield various powers such as illusion, hypnosis, healing, enchanting, and other effects. Teleportation would require calculating the distance and the energy required, while casting a fireball would require the calculations required for the fireball and the forces that would affect it.

With enough study and preparation, you can affect more of the world around you, producing effects that the humans of the DxD universe could only dream of.

Sunshine (The Seven Deadly Sins)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Your current form and power is no longer your maximum. Rather, it is your new minimum. At night, just after dusk and until dawn, you are as you are now. But the moment Dawn breaks, you begin to grow in power, magic, size and pride. As time progresses towards dawn, you will grow stronger and stronger, physically and magically, as well as more and more of a paragon of your race in appearance. You will begin to give off waves of light that are so hot that they can easily melt even the armour of a holy knight or gather this light into a miniature sun in your hand. When the sun hits its noon point, you will enter the state known as The One, a form so powerful that anything short of the Demon King himself is essentially powerless against your might, as well as having grown to gargantuan sizes in comparison to your original form. During the day, the burning light that emanates from your body will also suffuse your soul, affecting any who try to attack or devour it. This power will begin to leave you as the day turns from Noon towards Dusk, finally disappearing entirely as night falls and awaiting until the next day. You also gain the Divine Axe Rita if you wish it.

*Eternal Sunshine*  
Required:Immortal Sun  
Your nature as a sun infuses your magical abilities gained from Sunshine, you are now always at your peak, perpetually at Noon, as long as you allow it, for you can dampen and raise your magical power as you please.

*The Strongest Archangel*  
Required:Angel (DxD)  
Due to Being a Angel your essence has resonated with the Divine Grace known to the Goddess Clan as Sunshine you have inherited the skill and ability possessed by the first user and strongest of the Four Archangels Mael, Mael's mastery of Sunshine allowed him to accomplish feats not even Escanor could do such as being able to create a intense ball of Sunlight which almost felt close to Noon despite it being an hour or two after it. As well as being able to fight the original Demon on even ground Along with Zeldris two Demons second only to the Demon King himself in power. His Mastery of Sunshine ultimately allows you to more efficiently use its power and with greater control preventing environmental damage as well as bring out its full potential which could potentially allow you to defeat the Demon King or even the Supreme Goddess in a fight.

Arc of Embodiment Magic (Fairy Tail)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Arc of Embodiment Magic is a Lost Magic that utilizes your own imagination, allowing you to materialize anything you can imagine, so long as you have sufficient enough magical energy to create them. The more powerful the item or the potential it has, the more energy is required to make it. From objects, to weapons, and to an extent, even creatures or people. A magic like this, of course, has a few limits to its usage. Along with this Lost Magic, you have unlocked your Ethernano container, which allows you to generate and store magic power regardless of your location.

Firstly, while you are able to conjure beasts, creatures, and people, you are unable to conjure anything that can truly be considered as alive. For example, you can create a dragon that can use a type of magic, but for all intents and purposes, it is closer to an object than a living being. It is unable to truly speak for itself and follows your orders to the letter. It is without a soul, no matter how close to life-like you make it. If someone has the power to possess objects, then they can possess anything you make using this magic.

Secondly, you are unable to create a 1:1 replica of a specific person or creature that is still alive. You can make a generic person, or even a creature you dreamt up that has a name, but you are unable to make a replica of your friend, or your cat specifically. If your friend or cat is dead, then it’s fair game, but the first limit still applies.

Finally, while you can make something that stores or boosts your magic power, you are unable to make anything that can manipulate, erase, or otherwise mess with a person’s type of magic or power(s). For example, you could make an item that can disable people’s usage of magic for a limited time, but you are unable to make a power that outright erases them or changes the way those magics work or express themselves.

If you do not have enough magical power to materialize something, you can bargain with your magic to get the energy to make it, but in exchange for losing something for a set time. You can exchange many things, such as your ability to use your magic, your physical strength, your sight, your hearing, your intelligence, etc. You can even exchange esoteric or intangible things, such as your luck or some of your memories.  
Note, however, that exchanging just one thing may not be enough to pay the price. You may have to exchange more than one of these if you wish to create a truly powerful object if you do not have the magical power to materialize it yourself. The more magical energy you do not have to materialize the thing you wish, the more you will have to give up in order to do so.  
*Imaginary Factory*  
Required:Golem Factory (Automata Gigue)  
With the ability to breathe life into the lifeless creations you materialize, you now have a method to bend, if not outright break the first limit of Arc of Embodiment Magic, so long as you pay the right price of lifeforce or inner energy. This has eased up on the second limit as well, allowing you to materialize golems modeled after people or creatures who are still alive, and animate them that way. The Third limit remains unbroken and must still be followed.  
*Spiritus Vitae*  
Required:Golem Factory (Automata Gigue)  
Required:Aura (RWBY)  
When you awaken your creations like how you would a golem, the newly awakened aura of your creations now makes them more like living beings rather than soulless objects. They will eventually be able to act and speak for themselves, having been given a spark of personality that will slowly grow over time. Despite this, they will still follow your orders as they normally would, as you are their creator. If it wasn’t already broken, the first limit has now been completely bypassed using these methods, and the second is inconvenient at worst. While some of your creations can awaken a semblance that lets them manipulate powers, ultimately, you have no sort of control over what semblances they gain whatsoever. Other than that, the third limit remains as is.

Elder Blood (The Witcher)  
Cost: 20 SP  
You have the inherent potential to warp time and space. The basic use of this power allows you to mimic super-speed, combat teleport, and even teleport long distances. With practice and training, one can travel the breadth of the Omniverse, capable of going to any other dimensions, and even through time itself.

Gates of Babylon (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 40 SP  
You own and control a pocket dimension containing the original version of every single treasure that humanity knows of, and more. Every invention, every making, every forging, every last creation, every natural resource, every divine artifact, every last treasure that mankind has found, created, knows of, or has appeared in the world, past, present, or future, is found within this endless vault of space. The volume of your treasury has by far exceeded your knowledge so you do not know what every single item you own does or how it looks.  
You can expel any items in your pocket dimension by opening a portal between dimensions that allows for the contents to pass through upon your command. You can summon items directly into your hand, pull out weapons from directly behind you, or prepare numerous weapons midair, loaded like bullets, to be expelled at hypersonic speeds.  
Anything you throw out, can be retrieved back into your treasury with a thought.

Mystic Eyes (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 15 SP  
It is through the eyes that the soul’s power is made manifest. Some eyes show that power a lot more strongly than others. You possess a pair of very high class Mystic Eyes, that are capable of an incredibly powerful magical effect transmitted through sight. It can be as forcibly bending to your will anyone that looks into your eyes to, as advanced as granting you powerful sight-based telekinesis. Whatever you choose, it is extremely difficult for others to resist the effects and even those with potent magical resistance still likely feel a reduced effect instead of nothing. Given the magical nature, you can also choose what your eyes look like.

Mystic Eyes of Death Perception (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 20 SP  
All things die eventually. No matter how clever you are or what paradox you invoke to escape it, all that is born ‘alive’ into this world will eventually leave it. You are able to see the conceptual manifestation of death up close with your eyes. Able to perceive ‘death’ itself on living beings and physical objects, appearing as thin red lines. When you touch or cut along these lines, the object or being in question is immediately cut deeply and entirely regardless of their durability, and attempts at healing or regeneration are completely stunted. though the lines can become thinner and more difficult to target the tougher the being or object is.

At first, these lines are all you can perceive and influence, but after some time passes, they will become clearer to your eyes, and you will eventually see circular ‘points’ on their body that the lines all trace back to. Cutting or stabbing this point of death directly will immediately kill the target in question; no form of reincarnation, resurrection, or regeneration will save them from the bitter taste of death. This is what it means to kill something.

You may eventually be able to understand and perceive the concept of death in less tangible things, such as the spells of Magecraft or the empty space between you and an object, though some things can only be ‘cut’, not ‘killed’, for they have no point of death. However, perceiving how fragile the world and existence as a whole is something no human mind can truly bear witnessing. This would not be the case for you. When your eyes are active, the perception of death will have no strain on your mind and will cause no negative or unwanted impact or side effects on your brain, body, or mental health from continued use. You are also able to activate and use these eyes for as long as you wish to, and you have equal potential for perceiving and understanding death as Shiki's eyes.

The ‘points’ of death may never appear for certain beings, beings that were never ‘born’ or are free of the concept of death entirely, such as a True Ancestor at the peak of their power during the night of a full moon. You would have to remove the source of their immortality or introduce them to the possibility of mortality in a different way, though hard to achieve but not impossible for your eyes.  
Eyes of Balor (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 40 SP  
Required:Mystic Eyes of Death Perception (Type-Moon)  
Your eyes have been upgraded to it's prototypical form turning into the Divine Eyes of Balor. Because of your eye's divine origin, you could actualize death simply by looking at the target and tracing the lines of death through your eyes. Moreover, these pair of eyes also work on beings not having the concept of death, by impressing the concept of Death upon them, thereby making them mortal. The only limitation of the eyes are how far you can perceive and the range of your vision. The eyes may have further abilities which you may discover through time.

Mystic Eyes of Petrification (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 25 SP  
In the realm of rarity and rarity alone, the manifestation of beauty emerges, a splendor so pure that mortals ought never to possess it. What you now hold are the highest order of Mystic Eyes, the eyes of Cybele, unparalleled in their magnificence, beyond the replication of any magecraft. These violet jewels possess an allure so captivating that even the gaze of deities would pause to marvel at their brilliance. However, their true power lies not just in their beauty, but in their ability to induce an unconditional petrification upon anyone who comes within the user's line of sight, whether they meet their gaze or not. You can even with time and practice induce petrification through your memory of the intended target(s).

These eyes are all-encompassing, and their effects impossible to block with any form of protection, even capable of reaching the very essence of living beings, their souls. The more prolonged the exposure to the powers of your eyes, the deeper the petrification, leading to a complete state of stone-like rigidity and even true death. Beings of the same power of the user would find themselves instantly petrified. Though the pace of petrification may vary depending on the power gap between the target and the user, but no being, no matter how superior, or more powerful than the user, could escape the inevitable fate under the power of your divine eyes.

These mystical eyes will additionally provide a massive superhuman boost to the user's vitality and overall physical attributes. Owning such a rare and potent treasure would also elevate your physical appearance significantly, granting a two-level boost in attractiveness. Even those considered average, with these eyes alone they would take on an alluring charm akin to supermodel status.

These eyes are utterly indestructible and an unchangeable aspect of the user's existence, as the wielder retains full control over them, where they can selectively or fully toggle their eyes' effects on or off at will, and would suffer no drawbacks or fatigue from continuous use.

Magecraft (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 10 SP  
You have gained the ability to perform Magecraft—the reenactment of Mysteries/Miracles, using magical energy as a shortcut to achieve what science could accomplish, bypassing typical constraints through supernatural means. Magecraft then operates on the principle of equivalent exchange, transforming magical energy from the user or the environment to manifest predetermined phenomena, analogous to executing a Program (Spell) through Commands aligned with your System (Foundation).

However, Magecraft has limitations. It cannot create something from nothing, nor can it cross into the territory of True Magic and generate new Mysteries. Instead, it acts within the bounds of what is theoretically possible, only enhancing this potential through the expenditure of magical energy.

You have an innate understanding of any school of Magecraft of your choice, surpassing the average magi, allowing you to learn and comprehend its intricacies with remarkable ease. Depending on the world you've found yourself in, the properties and potency of the Mysteries around you may vary, sometimes being more powerful or muted than those within the Type-Moon series.

You begin with a choice of between 20-100 magic circuits, with their quality scaling inversely to the quantity chosen—the fewer you have, the higher their quality and better composition they'll be. Alongside this, you have the unique ability to improve these circuits' quality through focused training.

Even if you find yourself outside a Type-Moon world, you'll still have access to the mana and Thaumaturgical Foundations necessary to use your Magecraft, at least on par with the modern standards of Fate/Stay Night.  
*Magecraft Network*  
Required:Chakra (Naruto)  
Your chakra network and magic circuits seamlessly integrate into a singular circulatory system, where the 361 chakra nodes transform into interconnected magic circuits. Simultaneously, the eight gates morph into potent pseudo-mana cores, capable of generating extraordinary levels of magical energy when opened at the expense of risking severe physical and spiritual strain. With diligent bodily and spiritual improvement, along with training, these risks can be significantly mitigated, excluding the formidable Gate of Death which will kill you without exceptional preparations. While you retain the capacity to use both systems independently, their synergy creates a more formidable whole. This integration alleviates the strain on your magic circuits, akin to managing your chakra system's normal limitations. Your ability to apply reinforcement and physical enhancement to yourself has markedly improved, reaching a level comparable to that of a servant. An innate mystery within you facilitates smoother integration of your Magecraft, and any rejection can be mitigated with sufficient energy. Should you gain the Factor of the Dragon upgrade it will transform each gate into lesser Mana Cores for 8 total, offering a constant quarter of their powers without recoil. Moreover, these cores can autonomously progress towards unlocking their full potential.  
*Eight Sacrament*  
Required:Holy Light (DxD)  
Your connection to the Holy Light of Yahweh (The God of the Bible) has connected you to the Thaumaturgical base of the Holy Church from Type-Moon. Giving you knowledge and skill in the the Holy Sacraments. Your inner Holy Light allows you to make even the most basic exorcism two times more potent against the creatures of Darkness, And you gain knowledge on how to create the basic tools of the Church such as the Black keys, Ash locks, and Keys of Providence created by the different Sacrament groups who Operate in the Moonlit World.  
You also gain the skill and ability of a graduated Executor from The different Sacrament divisions with the same being for Exorcist training from the Church in DXD.  
(Note:Should you Purchase the Violence of Heaven Upgrade you will gain knowledge of every Exorcism, Holy Rituals like Baptisms which can for example can keep you eternally youthful, Knowledge of how to create every Artifact used by the Church such as the Scriptures which are conceptual weapons but also the Skill and ability of the strongest Exorcists in Type-Moon).  
*Formal Craft*  
Required:Occult  
Through your occultic abilities and your mastery over magecraft, you have become a master of formal craft. As a result of your mastery of formal craft you have gained knowledge of bounded fields specifically made to stabilize and minimize the impact of outside variables.

Formal craft, at its core, is a process of tapping into the world's mana or any external magical energy through the use of rituals and materials to achieve magecraft. Using formal crafts requires no use of your circuits or your own magical energy and instead mainly taps into ley lines (or the world's equivalent).

Anything you can achieve through magecraft, you can achieve through formal craft, with you also having the ability to enhance magecraft or the effects of magecraft, but it will take both time and resources.   
*Wishcraft*  
Required:Holy Grail (Type-Moon)  
You possess the Thaumaturgical Attribute known as Wish-Granting, a trait previously seen only in the Justeaze model Homunculi, who served as vessels for the Holy Grail. This attribute allows you to enact miracle-like magic.

In practice, this means you can actualize any effect possible through Magecraft, even those you may not fully understand.

The only limitations are that you can’t fully replicate Old or True Magics \- although some lesser applications may be fair game. Additionally, Wishcraft is inefficient and requires more Prana than normal Magecraft to compensate for your lack of understanding of the effects you wish to actualize.  
Enigmatic Mysteries (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:Magecraft (Type-Moon)  
Your Mysteries will never decrease in effectiveness, only growing stronger with time. You will always be able to uncover new Mysteries with enough time and research. You will always be able to perform Magecraft regardless of location. You are a Mystery on your own, fueling your Magecraft with the wisps of your endless future potential. Your circuits are no longer static, allowing you to craft new circuits and increase their quality with no limitation, making multiple Magic Crests is not an impossibility for you. You are able to craft new magic circuits that are meant for a singular form of Magecraft, improving the initial efficacy of the specialized circuit tenfold at the cost of all non-specialized Magecraft being ineffective. Your soul will not be overloaded at any point due to too many circuits, removing the innate pain of Magecraft. Given enough time and practice, every Mystery of yours can reach the realm of True Magic.

Old Magic (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 25 SP  
You are capable of Old Magic from the Age of the Gods that is equal in strength to the True Magics. Along with being capable of this, you are capable of any form of magic used in any universe you travel to as long as over 1% of the population has the potential to use it. To power your abilities you have a truly massive (though not nearly infinite) reservoir of mana inside you that will self generate through ancient breathing techniques from a time long since past. On top of this you gain the ability to use modern magecraft and learn more about Magic and Magecraft just from using what you do know through practice and combat, though this process is slow.  
You are also a beginner in one of these three magics:

Divine Words: This is magic from the Age of The Gods. Unlike modern magi who need incantations to cast their spells, you're always surrounded by divine mysteries of ancient lore, so magic is just something you can command like ordering a guard dog to attack. This is done through using an ancient language that modern humans can no longer pronounce to utilize a fraction of a god's authority. Such words include things like Αερο (Aero) which causes a plague wind that will easily mince your target as if they were sent through an enormous fan to others like Μαρδοξ (Argos) which makes a protective spell by borrowing the concept of the Argos.

Fairy Patterns: These are a unique type of magical circuits that usually only fairies have. Just like fairies you do not need incantations, Thaumaturgical Foundations, Mystic Codes or Formulas on what you want to do. Simply using the necessary amount of mana and having the imagination of what magic you want to cast will allow you to manipulate the world to cast such magic. The strength of your spells or creations using Fairy Patterns depends greatly on how much magical energy you expend and how great your imagination is. More complex actions such as mass healing multiple people with grievous wounds will take a lot more magical energy compared to something as simple as shooting a ball of fire. You also have a rudimentary knowledge of Fairy Letters, a language used to inscribe onto items crafted by the Fae to show it was not crafted by human hands.

Primordial Runes: These Runes hail from Scandinavia and could even be considered Scandinavian crests. Different from more modern Runes these are from the Age of the Gods. By either writing the necessary runic combination on something or simply tracing them in the air you can do things such as create massive tornados of fire with a gesture, creating a magical map of the continent you're on, healing lethal wounds, inflicting divine curses on your enemies, or even inscribe the primordial rune of death on a target to bring inescapable death upon them.  
Even outside of a world from the Type-Moon series, at bare minimum this power will generate Mystery equivalent to the modern world of Fate/Stay Night.  
*Old Master*  
Required:Magecraft (Type-Moon)  
Now not only have you mastered the fundamentals of Magecraft, but you have also mastered many of its branches as well as the ability to actualize (create spells) using both Magecraft and Old Magic simultaneously. You gain a century of experience to distribute between three to six branches of Magecraft such as Alchemy, Runes, Jewelcraft, Formalcraft, and many others. This experience cannot be spent on Old Magic.

This mastery gives you a good fundamental basis to understand all future magic and that not only makes you more powerful in other forms of magic but vastly increases the rate of learning and power of Magecraft, Old magic, and all other types of magic.

True Magic (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 25 SP  
As a beginner Magician wielding one of the True Magics, you possess the potential to manifest true Miracles—wondrous feats that lie beyond modern Magecraft and are unattainable even with centuries of accumulated magical knowledge. Your power operates on a level of Mystery so profound that it could only be unraveled by a turn in the very age of humanity, akin to Tesla's demystification of Lightning in the modern era. However, True Magic remains far beyond such an understanding, existing in a realm that defies complete comprehension, where even the most advanced Magecraft falters.

You can choose to have either one of the five known True Magics or create your own, as long as it fits the criteria.

You have also gained proficiency with all forms of Magecraft. With this power, you can perform modern Magecraft without magic circuits through ancient breathing techniques, seamlessly connecting to the flow of magical energy as you actualize Mysteries through your entire body.

This talent makes you an exceptional practitioner, able to wield spells and skills without the reliance typical of most magi. Through combat and practice, your knowledge of True Magic and Magecraft grows, the experience itself guiding you in understanding spells and principles. Although this learning process is slow, it adds a unique adaptability to your practice of True Magic, honing your instincts alongside formal knowledge.

The scope of your ability is vast, though equally restrained by your status as a novice. But at your current level, only brief flashes of your full potential are within reach, though this will change as you grow in skill. However, caution is paramount; even small applications of your power can have far-reaching consequences for the world—and perhaps the universe itself—if wielded recklessly. (See Aoko)

Even if you find yourself outside a Type-Moon world, you'll retain a minimum supply of mana, capable of tapping into the magical foundations of any world as if it were your own, matched to the Thaumaturgical Foundations equivalent to the modern-day from Fate/Stay Night at the bare minimum.  
*True Master*  
Required:Magecraft (Type-Moon)  
Now not only have you mastered the fundamentals of Magecraft, but you have also mastered many of its branches as well as the ability to actualize (create spells) using both Magecraft and True Magic simultaneously. You gain a century of experience to distribute between three to six branches of Magecraft such as Alchemy, Runes, Jewelcraft, Formalcraft, and many others. This experience cannot be spent on True Magic.

This mastery gives you a good fundamental basis to understand all future magic and that not only makes you more powerful in other forms of magic but vastly increases the rate of learning and power of Magecraft, True magic, and all other types of magic.  
*Grand Master*  
Required:Magecraft (Type-Moon)  
Required:Old Magic (Type-Moon)  
You are not a master, you are a walking legend on par with Zelretch, Merlin, and Solomon. Not only have you mastered over a dozen branches of Magecraft, but you have pushed your original magic (Old or True Magic) to its absolute limits allowing you discover the base secrets of a second magic (the other magic selected).

This means not only has your power and rate of learning Magecraft, Old Magic, True Magic, and other forms of magic been vastly improved, but you gain a further boost to discovering all other forms of Old and True Magics you don’t already know.

There is no magic beyond your reach and given enough time, preparation, and research, you can even kill a God.

Planeswalker (Magic: The Gathering)  
Cost: 25 SP  
Your Spark has ignited, one that the Pre-Mending Planeswalkers once held. You can planeswalk through the multiverse at your leisure. You can target any plane you have already visited easily but accessing a precise destination blindly will require some practice, in the meantime you will jump to semi-random destinations every time.

Your body is now a projection of your Soul, in time you will be able to alter your appearance at will and even replicate the abilities of other creatures. Your Soul is also a powerful source of Mana. While you are able to cast spells, you do not have the knowledge to do so.

In time, as you grow in power and familiarity with your abilities, you will be able to create your own pocket dimensions and planes.

### Spiritual and Divine

The Entity (Dead By Daylight)  
Cost: 40 SP  
You have transcended human limits, becoming something akin to a god—or perhaps a devil. Your very essence thrives on the negative emotions of mortals, feeding on their fear, despair, and anguish. This sustenance grants you an unerring ability to sense those ensnared in inner torment, identifying them as ripe for your manipulation, ideal candidates to join your ever-expanding army of ‘Killers.’  
Your power is rooted in fear, which you wield as both a resource and a weapon. This primal currency fuels your creations, enabling you to craft new horrors, each imbued with unique abilities designed to sow greater terror. To each Killer, you bestow a personal realm—a macabre domain tailored to their methods of carnage. These realms are living extensions of your will, reflecting the Killers’ essence while serving as arenas for their grim pursuits.

Your awareness stretches across these domains, approaching omniscience. You see, feel, and consume the suffering and dread that permeate every corner of these twisted realities. Through your fog-like portals, you can summon or ensnare survivors, transporting them into the nightmarish labyrinths of your creation. Here, the lines between prey and predator blur, as you orchestrate the relentless cycle of fear and death, feeding ever more on the torment you inspire.  
*The Fearborn*  
Required:Lord of Fear  
You are the embodiment of an endless cycle of fear and torment, a force that binds itself to the darkest corners of the human psyche. Like a living nightmare, you weave realms that reflect your victims’ fears and their unresolved traumas. The boundaries of your realms are shaped not only by the fear of those you ensnare but also by the echoes of their past—a reflection of guilt, anguish, and horrors they cannot escape from.  
Your realms are a twisted reflection of its inhabitants’ psyches. Your prey are trapped in a constantly shifting nightmare tailored to their deepest fears and unresolved anxieties, where the environment, the shadows, and the creatures within are all extensions of your will. They are stripped of hope and gradually broken, their minds warped under the weight of constant terror. Through psychological manipulation, torment, and exposure to their darkest vices, you reforge the strongest among them into Killers—twisted husks of their former selves, brainwashed and conditioned to hunt those who come after them. These Killers act as your agents, spreading fear and driving new prey deeper into your web. Each Killer reflects a unique manifestation of their personal trauma, their methods of hunting tailored to the fears they once suffered, now weaponized against others. This realm is alive, adaptive, and inescapable.  
Your strength feeds on the fear you induce. The more terror you evoke, the larger and more powerful your realms become. You can manipulate the landscape, summon monstrosities forged from the fears of your victims, and warp reality to disorient and trap them. At the height of your power, you can assume the form of their greatest nightmares, embodying the fears you have harvested.

DOMAIN EXPANSION: Golden Heart  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Cursed Energy Manipulation (Jujutsu Kaisen)  
Required:Agent of Change (Adventure Time)  
When this domain is deployed, you can draw upon the power of your predecessors more. But that is not the primary ability of this domain.  
This domain is not created to kill but to redeem. When it is deployed, the opponent will find the evil within them being actively suppressed. Even Cursed Energy will be actively suppressed. Your opponent will find it difficult to do anything with malicious intent.  
If they actively try to keep the evil and malice in their hearts, the suppression of their Cursed Energy will slowly become permanent.

DOMAIN EXPANSION: Prior Existence  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Cursed Energy Manipulation (Jujutsu Kaisen)  
Required:The Lich (Adventure Time)  
As the being who opposes all life, you are like the embodiment of Cursed Energy with the sheer size of your reserves. Cursed Energy not contained within an individual is constantly absorbed when near your presence, adding to reserves. When something dies near you, all of its Cursed Energy will be absorbed and increase your reserves permanently. Your cursed energy is also necrotic in nature, for when you damage an enemy with your Cursed Energy, they find it much harder to heal. When a cut would have taken at most a week to heal, it will now take months.  
As the Herald of the End, you also have Domain Expansion: Prior Existence. When This Domain is deployed, all current knowledge ceases to flow. In other words, the enemy wouldn't be able to see, feel, touch, smell, or do anything that involves information. For the poor soul you deployed it against, will find it virtually impossible to do anything.

DOMAIN EXPANSION: Frozen Madness  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Cursed Energy Manipulation (Jujutsu Kaisen)  
Required:Ice King (Adventure Time)  
Ice and snow, dancing with a glow\! Madness isn't a sin; it's a wild, ecstatic win\! Embrace the chaos, reject the status quo\! Strengthen your inhumanity, let the frozen frenzy grow\! When the frigid madness takes hold, it's not just radness; it's a carnival of joy, untamed and bold\! In the realm of frozen lunacy, there's no harm in the insanity; it's the very essence of a reality\!  
Your Cursed Energy has a special trait, for when it comes in contact with the enemy, it lowers their body temperature.  
You also have the Domain Expansion: Frozen Madness, and when it is deployed, everyone it encompasses will find their sanity slowly becoming more unstable as time passes by. As they lose their insanity, the environment also becomes cold. Very cold. A normal human would find themselves dead within 15 seconds.

Shrine (Jujutsu Kaisen)  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:Cursed Energy Manipulation (Jujutsu Kaisen)  
The innate cursed technique of the king of curses himself.

It has 3 functions, Cleave, Dismantle, and Divine Flame.

Dismantle is a ranged attack which you send out, the speed, size, and cutting power it has depends on the amount of cursed energy you use and your control over it. With greater control allowing you to choose which areas of the technique your cursed energy enhances. It is most effective against objects and entities that do not have cursed energy but can be used to great effect against sorcerers and cursed spirits anyhow.

The second, Cleave is a cut that adjusts itself towards the target's durability and cursed energy level in order to cut it while wasting the least amount of energy, but still cutting them down in one fell swoop. Unless used in a domain expansion, you have to make physical contact with what you want Cleave to attack, making it a close-range attack.

The Third, Divine Flame, is the ability to form an arrow of fire, this arrow can be shot out as though from a bow making it a long ranged attack, the temperature of this arrow is enough to burn to death even a special grade cursed spirit made from the fear of volcanoes, and other fire related disasters itself.  
*King of Curses*  
Required:I Alone Am The Honored One\! (Jujutsu Kaisen)  
Your control and handling of cursed energy is truly perfect, even better than a user of the Six Eyes. You have mastered each and every jujutsu ability the world has to offer, simple domains, barriers, shikigami, and even newer techniques such as falling blossom emotion and the new shadow style. Your ability to utilize and direct cursed energy is without equal and you can cook up new techniques and abilities using cursed energy as easily as merely conceptualizing them. Though mastering and utilizing them efficiently is another matter, though not one you need to concern yourself with for long, as your talent at mastering anything curse-related is truly insane.

Furthermore, your already unreal amount of cursed energy has skyrocketed and more than doubled, it may grow even further if you choose to consume the cursed spirit haunting you and take its power for yourself. After all, as the King of Curses, you need not rely on anyone, but yourself.  
*Ultimate Cut*  
Required:The Sanctioned Action (K6BD)  
The ability to cut anything, truly anything, is now yours.

Your comprehension of the Sanctioned Action and your innate technique have formed a truly monstrous power.  
Concepts, time, space, laws of reality, you can cut it all. Your Cleave and Dismantle has assimilated into one technique, Cut. Cut allows you to cut anything you can perceive or conceptualize. It has no travel time or physical form, what you attack with it is simply instantly cut in whichever way you want it to. The efficiency of Cut is so great that even if you continually use it for days on end you still wouldn't run out of cursed energy, and that is with an average reserve of cursed energy.

To Stand Over Heaven (JJBA)  
Cost: 30 SP  
Required:Stand (JJBA)  
After rigorous training and unlocking the full potential of your Stand, you have achieved the extraordinary ability known as "To Stand Over Heaven." With this upgrade, you can access any canon Stand from the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure universe, with the exceptions of "The World Over Heaven" and "Made in Heaven." Initially, you can switch to any canon Stand, but you are limited to using one Stand at a time.

As you progress and grow in power, you will gain the capability to wield multiple Stands simultaneously. This newfound proficiency allows you to combine a diverse array of Stand abilities, making you a more formidable force on the battlefield. The fusion of different Stand powers grants you unparalleled versatility, enabling you to adapt to any situation and overcome challenges.

However, the ultimate pinnacle of your power lies in mastering Requiem and Stand Combination. With time and experience, you will acquire the ability to access the Requiem form of any Stand you are using temporarily, significantly enhancing its power and capabilities, however, through training you will be able to use the Requiem form of any Stand permanently. And through Stand Combination, you can merge multiple Stands into one, amplifying their power and creating an awe-inspiring Stand known as "The One Above Heaven."

Nonetheless, attaining such extraordinary heights comes with great risks. The power of Stand combination is a double-edged sword, and you must tread carefully to prevent being overwhelmed by the sheer force of this amalgamation. While "The One Above Heaven" grants you unparalleled might, it also demands immense control and focus to prevent the power from consuming you. To access "The World Over Heaven" and "Made in Heaven", you will need to undergo specific rituals or go through intense training to unlock their potential.  
*Heaven Ascension*  
Required:THE Ultimate Lifeform (JJBA)  
As the Ultimate Lifeform, the apex of all living beings, your mastery over your Stand has evolved to unprecedented heights, reaching a level no one ever has. This newfound power, known as "Heaven Ascension" grants you access to every single stand from JJBA, including "The World Over Heaven", "Made in Heaven", and even Stands from alternative universes like JORGE JOESTAR, alongside making all your Stands reach their Ultimate versions, significantly enhancing their abilities.

As The Ultimate Lifeform, you can now effortlessly transform your Stand into its Requiem mode whenever you desire, and maintain this state for as long as you wish. Moreover, combining Stands has become much easier, allowing you to merge more stands and their powers seamlessly.

Not only that, you've gained the ability to create entirely new Stands over time, including new variations of stand types like Wounds, Bounds, and Beyonds. Even more astonishingly, you can now bestow Stands upon others simply by touching them.

Your power of "Understanding" has been greatly enhanced, enabling you to instantly comprehend and master even the most foreign or esoteric concepts effortlessly. With a single glance, even the most unique or rare abilities can be comprehended by you now.

Shun Shun Rikka (Bleach)  
Cost: 35 SP  
Required:Reiryoku (Bleach)  
Shun Shun Rikka is composed of six spirits that you can instantly summon and dismiss, and which reside within a six petal flower-shaped hairpins, each of which is two petals on the clip when inactive, and only spiritually aware beings can see them. Through various combinations of the six fairies, you have the power to reject phenomena by denying or undoing events in various forms. This power can be used for attack, defense, or healing (depending on the combination), and if used to its full capabilities can rival gods.  
The spirits are separate manifestations of your own soul, each with its own unique appearance and personality.  
Two spirits (Ayame, and Shun'ō) are in charge of healing. They surround something to return it to its former, complete state, by rejecting, reversing, and reconstructing phenomena that have occurred, even phenomena that you haven't witnessed. You can even fully resurrect the dead with this.  
The other Three spirits (Hinagiku, Baigon, and Lily) are in charge of defense. By placing a shield of any size between the enemy and target, that can repel all forms of attacks. This shield is impenetrable because of its event rejection nature.  
The last spirit Tsubaki is in charge of offense. It can cut through basically anything, by rejecting the fusion of something, and repelling it, splitting it in two.  
You can also combine the offensive and defensive spirits together, to create a shield that can disperse the incoming attack, and then reflect it back at full force towards the assailant. The full extent of this power can only be explored by you.  
These spirits exhibit unwavering loyalty solely to you, dedicating themselves to serving you to the best of their abilities. When subjected to damage, the fairies can transform back into their hairpin form, undergoing passive regeneration with a maximum recovery time of 24 hours.  
As long as your soul endures, the hairpins remain indestructible.

Book of the End (Bleach)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:Fullbringer (Bleach)  
You gain access to the Fullbring of Shūkurō Tsukishima, which you can summon and dismiss freely in both its bookmark and sword forms. As a katana, it can be used as a high-quality weapon comparable to a Zanpakutō with incredible sharpness. But its real power lies in its ability to manipulate the past.

Whenever the user chooses to activate the sword's power, it will manipulate the targeted object’s or being’s past by inserting the user into its history, with the option to prevent the blade from actually harming your target in the traditional way. This would allow you to cut the ground and insert yourself into its history, laying a trap in the location, repair an object by changing its history in a way you prevented it from breaking in the first place, or make yourself the childhood friend of your enemy, making them hesitate. You also gain a comprehensive knowledge of the altered history you insert into others', giving you the capability to obtain an immense amount of knowledge and skills in an instant.  
This will also synergize with your other powers exceptionally well, as you will always have access to your full capabilities as you insert yourself into the past, which can be used creatively. For example, you could cut your homework to have it done by yesterday, cut a flask of water, changing its past to be an elixir you brewed via alchemy, or change the history of somebody by making them have a magical contract, forcing them to be your familiar.

The only real weakness of the Fullbring is the fact that its rewriting of history only affects your direct target(s), so if you are not careful, other people can recognise inconsistencies like you inserting yourself into your target’s history by hanging out with them but then others pointing out you were in fact at work that day.

Finally, your Fullbring is attached to your soul on a conceptual level, which allows it to grow in power just like any normal power you get here, and it can slowly recover in its unsummoned state if it gets damaged or broken.  
*Author of the Past*  
Required:Michibane (Bleach)  
Thanks to your increased capabilities as a Fullbringer, your Fullbring evolved, getting rid of its primary weakness. This allows your history altering to spread out from your target, granting you the capability of truly rewriting history on a grand scale. But using this will increase the cost of spiritual power with every extra affected person and/or object, making its cost scale with the scale of your history editing.  
*Self-Insert of the Beginning*  
Required:Reincarnation  
With your ability to reincarnate, your Fullbring developed a new ability to forcefully rewrite your own past. By stabbing somebody now, you can rewrite the past in a way that you can actually become a biological relative of them, as if you were reincarnated into their family. You will always retain all of the powers and perks you obtained here, on top of whatever you gain from your new bloodline. This ability has an immense spiritual power cost, possibly even knocking out the user from exhaustion.  
*Universal Bookmark*  
Required:Alibi Block (Medaka Box)  
Now, you can apply Alibi Block to the past of anyone you've cut, enabling you to physically travel back in time and appear in their past. You will leave behind an instinctual bookmark in the “present” allowing you to instantly reappear whenever you want in the original timeline, which is now changed by whatever you did.

*Ōtsutsuki*  
Required:Tenseigan (Naruto)  
It seems the combined blood of Hagaromo and Hamura has given you the very chakra and abilities of Kaguya herself. Alongside this something else has happened, you’ve no longer inherited that of those that bare the name Ōtsutsuki and their incarnations, you seemed to have inherited the combined physical ability, chakra, skill, wisdom, talent, jutsu, and knowledge of every single descendant of Kaguya. You’ve also gained the ability to implant Kama’s into others to help avoid death, although yours are special as there will never be any incompatibility with any hosts you possess, and you can freely choose whether your hosts will obtain a White Kama or a true one. Your hosts cannot use the power gifted by the Kama against you, nor can they access unless you wish for them to be able to. When you reincarnate you other hosts will not lose their Kamas.

Required:Chakra Fruit (Naruto)  
Required:Hagoromo (Naruto)  
Required:Tenseigan (Naruto)  
You’ve grown and grown, travelled thousands of worlds, cultivated and consumed countless chakra fruits until you’ve finally achieved what every Ōtsutsuki chases, Godhood. Your chakra is now on a scale none could dare have imagined, they are now divine miracles itself. You possess various remarkable abilities such as clairvoyance and automatic reflection of all harm to yourself. You no longer need a physical form and may freely discard your body and ascend to higher realms if you wish, you exist as a chakra being for all intents and purposes and hold a body only when you desire. Alongside this, all your dōjutsu have merged into a single one, the Jōgan. This power, while supremely powerful, only grants three abilities. You may still freely access your lower level dōjustu, and all of their abilities carry over to the Jōgan.

Zengo, with this ability the Jōgan grants absolute perception and complete comprehension of all things. From the barriers between dimensions, to the interactions of particles so small and so fast they could be said to have not happened at all, to even peering into the Pure Lands themselves.  
Zenjiyuu, with this ability the Jōgan grants it’s wielder true and absolute freedom. It removes all limitations and constraints. Your chakra no longer has to be mixed, controlled, altered or anything. It is not constrained by amount, potency, or type; it simply does what you wish for it to do. You are unbounded by any limits, whether they be physical or mental. You are free to move, think, and act as you please without fear of any kind of restriction or confinement. You can float effortlessly above the ground or race along at superhuman speed. Your mind is limitless, with capacity for analytical reasoning, imagination and creativity beyond human understanding. You can penetrate any mind or shield, gaining knowledge and insight that might otherwise be impossible for mere mortals. Your very form is free to change whenever you wish, capable of swapping its natures and properties whenever you wish. Even universal laws of physics, time and space hold no power over you, for you are truly free if you wish to escape those constraints.  
Zennō, and with this final ability the Jōgan grants you the ability to rewrite reality itself. You’ve now the ability to alter everything around you as you wish, capable of writing whole worlds into existence if you choose.

As the creator of Ninjutsu himself, you’ve gained enormous talent and genius with jutsu in particular. Creating a new jutsu is now as simple for you as it is for a normal man to construct a sentence. Your chakra quality and potency is doubled and your chakra control is perfect. All your Dōjutsu are further amplified by an order of magnitude.

Asura (Naruto)  
Cost: 6 SP  
Required:Hokage (Naruto)  
Required:Senju (Naruto)  
Required:Uzumaki (Naruto)  
It seems there is a bit of irony here, as just like some of your predecessors were, you yourself are an incarnation of the Sage’s second son Asura. But it seems even for an incarnation of Asura you are special. You have not simply inherited his talent, chakra and will like others, no, you have inherited everything from both Asura and every incarnation after him. Asura inherited his father’s incredibly powerful body and chakra. While his brother was a solitary man, Asura was known to gain followers and comrades by the droves. Likewise his brother’s bloodline spawned only the ever powerful Uchiha clan, Asura spread and created several. From his most powerful bloodlines the Uzumaki and Senju, to lesser known clans such as the Kaguya, or even Jūgo’s now near extinct clan, every chakra nature and body based bloodline can eventually trace their lineage back to Asura. Aside from greatly amplifying your previous abilities, you now possess the ability to instinctively wield and mix all chakra natures and can freely modify your body as you wish. Weaponize your blood and bones, utilize lava and wood to alter the battlefield, or freely manipulate your chakra’s shape and inherent properties at will.

You have also been granted a truly immense reserve of chakra surpassing even EOS Naruto though not by that much, have enough strength to uproot an entire God Tree with a single physical attack, enough speed to appear as if you teleported a kilometer and a half away, the reaction speed to dodge light beams, and enough resilience/regeneration to survive being cut in half and regenerate from it.

*Chakra Ancestor*  
Required:Chakra Fruit (Naruto)  
Due to the consumption of the chakra fruit, you have now evolved and achieved a whole new level of power never seen before. Your chakra reserves are enhanced to a monstrous level, matching and surpassing an entire planet’s worth of chakra, blowing even Madara's chakra reserve when he became the Juubi’s Jinchūriki out of the water, meaning that you can wipe out countries and continents easily, and if pushed can destroy a planet with your chakra techniques. You now have access to every Kekkei Genkai and Mora in the show or manga, and can create your own.  
Your physical stats have risen insanely, such that your punches with no chakra enchantment could easily wipe out countries and subcontinents, while you can withstand planet destroying attacks and your movement speed/reaction speed is comparable to light.  
You can choose to keep your normal appearance, maybe with horns or pure white skin if you want, or gain a similar demonic-like form gained by both Momoshiki and Urashiki  
.  
*Banbutsu*  
Required:Rinnegan (Naruto)  
With the addition of the Rinnegan you’ve unlocked and mastered three incredibly powerful Onmyōton techniques, one of which the very Sage of Six Paths used to create the Bijū.

The third and final technique is Banbutsu Henkō, Modification of All Things. By applying both above techniques, one has the ability to modify any existing thing their chakra can get a hold of. By utilizing Yang to take control of an existing thing and then converting it into Yin to reshape and reform from your imagination then back into Yang to bring it back into physical form.

Sage Mode (Naruto)  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Chakra (Naruto)  
You have acquired the ability to use Senjutsu, a specialized field of jutsu that involves harnessing the natural energy that exists in the world and merging it with your own chakra. While most people who attempt this risk turning to stone or transforming into an animal, you have complete control over your Nature Chakra, preventing these drawbacks.  
Once you gather enough natural energy and merge it with your chakra, you enter Sage Mode. In this form, your physical strength, speed, stamina, reflexes, perception, and durability are greatly enhanced. For example, in Sage Mode, you could lift a house-sized rhino and hurl it over your head nearly a hundred feet into the air. Weapons made of iron or steel that would normally pierce your body like butter would shatter against your skin. Enemies who could once track your movements will now struggle as you effortlessly outmaneuver them.  
Sage Mode also enhances your ninjutsu and genjutsu, while allowing you to amplify your taijutsu with nature energy, enabling unique and powerful attacks. Additionally, if you couldn't previously sense the life force of enemies, you now can, allowing you to detect attacks without needing to see them.  
If you face an enemy capable of draining chakra, they are likely to die by turning to stone, as your control over Nature Chakra does not extend to them.  
While most practitioners of Senjutsu need to remain still and meditate for minutes or even hours to gather chakra, you can simply clasp your hands together and gather enough natural energy to power your Sage Mode for an hour in just seconds.  
*One with Nature*  
Required: Nature Magic (Warcraft), or Street Druid  
Your internal pool of natural energy allows you to do what was previously thought impossible and become the perfect Sage. Due to your natural energy being sourced from yourself like your physical and spiritual energies, all your Chakra will naturally transform into Senjutsu Chakra, allowing you to enter Sage Mode indefinitely. You will naturally be in Sage Mode by default, but draining your natural energy too quickly can result in you being knocked out of it. You also receive additional benefits due to converting your Natural Techniques into Sage Techniques.  
If you have Nature Magic, then your druidic shapeshifting gives you access to the sage transformation of Jugo’s clan. This enhances your physical capabilities while allowing you to transform your appendages into various weapons and other such transformations like those displayed by users of Orochimaru’s cursed seals.  
If you have Street Druid, then your ability to commune with nature allows you to learn all its techniques. This enhances your spiritual capabilities, allowing you to create new techniques based on any of nature’s animals. This allows you to create new paths on the road to Sagehood that may one day rival the ways of the snakes, slugs, and toads.  
If you have Keeper of the Grove, you will become the greatest Senjutsu Master the world has ever known.  
*One with the World*  
Required:Senjutsu (DxD)  
Your skill and talent with Senjutsu from the World of DXD have given you the ability to overcome Sage Mode's weaknesses.  
Notably, you don't need to stay still and meditate allowing you to draw in natural energy with less effort.  
You can purify the land around you, improving the natural energy quality you draw upon yourself by an immense degree.  
Examples include having the strength to lift and throw Tailed Beasts with little effort and strong enough to smash holes in mountains from the sheer force of your strikes.  
Any techniques you use whether through Chakra or DXD Senjutsu also gain a significant increase in power.

The user's aura can also be manifested in an opaque, flame-like state which can destroy enemy attacks on contact. In contrast to Ultra Instinct, which draws upon the principles of conquering oneself, while Ultra Ego seems to draw upon a severe level of self-indulgence in battle. Whereas Ultra Instinct allows a user's efficiency and power to increase as they continue to evade and counterattack, Ultra Ego allows the user's overall power to increase as they take more damage and delve more into their lust for battle.  
The heightened lust for battle required for this state can cause the user to act rashly. Taking damage in order to fuel one's battle lust and become stronger can backfire if the user accumulates too much physical damage to continue fighting effectively

Across the Abyss (Raildex)  
Cost: 25 SP  
You have crossed the abyss of Da'at, a void that binds all of the Sephirot. Thus, you have stepped into the Territory of God, obtaining Daʻat Elyon, Higher Knowledge on the workings of the universe. Rather than getting encyclopedic knowledge of every technique or spell, this gives you an intuitive understanding of the underlying principles of both natural and supernatural parts of the world.  
With but a glance, you can comprehend how powers, spells, and even basic energies interact and function at their most fundamental level. Allowing you to interfere with the inner workings of those phenomena. Potentially, you will be able of even such feats as fundamentally changing the cosmology of the universe itself, albeit it will take a great deal of preparation.  
As you see the truth of the world, you are unaffected by the changes to reality and timelines. While your perceived history may change, your true self can never be rewritten, even if someone recreates a universe dozens of times over.  
Finally, this newfound knowledge also extends to your own powers. You start off with complete mastery over every single aspect of the powers currently available to you, thus obtaining an unshakeable foundation which you can freely improve upon, easily incorporating newly encountered phenomena and principles into your powers, or developing entirely new aspects from scratch.  
This also puts you and your powers on a fundamentally higher level of existence, with those who have not stepped into the abyss being inherently lower than you on a cosmic hierarchy. Your abilities are now beyond the reach of such beings; thus, they cannot tamper with or otherwise affect them, and any attempts to resist your powers will be much less effective.  
Do note that you can still be overwhelmed by the sheer firepower, although somebody who has not crossed the abyss like you or achieved a similar state will need to be at least multiple orders of magnitude stronger than you to even begin to contend with you.

Even after your ascension, your soul continues to constantly evolve to new heights. As such, it now naturally generates a transcendantal energy of higher quality than anything you can naturally encounter in any world, with every energy source within you subsumed into one pool.  
This transcendental energy can be used as a substitute for any other form of supernatural energy, such as mana, chakra, psionic energy, and so on, allowing you to directly interfere with any supernatural system. Moreover, with transcendent energy being inherently of higher quality, all of your spells, abilities, etc. that utilise it will become exponentially more potent, and any usage of this energy becomes completely undetectable to those who did not reach similar levels of strength and enlightenment.

With your knowledge, you can effortlessly interfere with the spells and abilities of your adversaries, cancelling, hijacking, reverse-engineering, and even improving upon them.

You have been imbued with the essence of Hades, Lord and God of the Dead, and Ruler of the Greek Underworld, specifically the Underworld seen in Disney’s Hercules-”Ugh.” \-With this, you gain his godly physiology, his power, the Underworld itself, among a few other things. As a small bonus, you have become a master in the arts of dark humor, quick wit, and smooth talking. With this, your charisma is, simply put, divine. Even when everyone doesn’t trust you at all, you’re able to trap even other gods in your casually honeyed words, effectively becoming a paragon of what every sleazy car salesman dreams of becoming one day.

Firstly, as the God of the dead, you possess powerful abilities, such as raising the dead, animating corpses, and having them do your bidding. You have a body made of smoke, able to turn intangible at any given time. Not only are you immensely durable and strong, as a God would be, but you’re also immortal in the ageless sense. You can die, but you’ll be banished to the Underworld and are forbidden from exiting for a set time depending on-”How hard you get your butt kicked\~\! Don’t rely on it too much though, kid. It’s not fun.”

With your-”Smokin’ hot bod-”, you have access to both typhokinesis and pyrokinesis, able to generate and manipulate those two elements constantly if you wish. You can conjure inanimate objects using your smoke, such as liquids, cigarettes, thrones, chariots, etc., and use these elements as a medium to transport creatures from the Underworld (along with people who owe you or you own) to your location. From jet black alicorns and small imps, to three-headed dogs and hydras, you’ve got quite the menagerie of monsters at your beck and call.

You can make deals, wagers, and pacts with anyone who agrees with your terms. ”Make the rules, use that newly gained charisma, and souls, power, people, all sorts of things and doo-dads just fall right into your lap. Word of caution, though. The people you’re making deals with can just as easily bend the rules as you can, provided they got enough wit on ‘em.”

The Underworld follows your every word, and the living shudder at your name. All hail Hades, God of the Dead.  
”And hey, if you ever do see Wonder Boy, give him a good punch in the throat for me. As a thank you, of sorts. Sure, it was never my way of doing things, but seeing as I’m trapped here for the time being, ‘needs must’ and all that.”

At advanced levels, to sense the presence of Sacred Gears in people or read the movements of others just from their aura.  
Senjutsu heavily relies on an understanding of nature, so most of the techniques are related to it, like manipulation of mud, earth, and plants, but it struggles with manipulation of the artificial.  
Normally, all Senjutsu users are capable of learning Touki as it forms a complete power system, but for this CYOA, it is treated as a separate power, which makes you incapable of learning Touki just from Senjutsu, unless it is purchased.

You obtain the power to wield the Holy Light, which is a part of the divine power system governing divine protection, mercy, and miracles, making it possible to practice exorcism, wield and grant blessings, and even sanctify objects like holy water and crosses. Your power is especially effective against dark beings like devils, fallen angels, and vampires.

This also gives you a strong holy factor, which makes you a naturally talented wielder of all kinds of holy weapons, and experienced users could even master the legendary Holy Fist technique by undergoing rigorous and constant training.

Of course, the Holy Light is not limited to using weapons and rituals; you can also fire off blasts of the Holy Power, and with sufficient mastery, you might even form the light into much more deadly projectiles like the Angel’s spear of light.

Your talent and affinity for the element allow you to tap into other power systems as long as they are connected to the light. And the holy element and light element can also be wielded and recombined separately, which can be used to master powers like holy lightning, holy fire, or even pure light manipulation.

Touki (DxD)  
Cost: 7 SP

Touki is an external manifestation of life-force in the form of a white aura wrapped around the user, amplifying their offence, defence, and speed. Releasing high amounts of Touki can generate wind pressure and crack the ground around the user. At advanced mastery, it can also be channelled through weapons, disperse attacks, cause massive shockwaves, or even be used as a ranged projectile.

The natural colour of the aura changes when combined with other powers.

Overconsumption of life-Force can cause permanent harm to the user’s lifespan, which requires specialized healing to restore.  
*Elemental Touki Cloak*  
Required:Chakra (Naruto)  
Combining your touki with chakra infused by the element you have affinity for allows you to form an elemental cloak. Your aura will change colour based on your affinity and enhance it based on the element.

Power of Dominance (Castlevania)  
Cost: 20 SP  
This is the greatest and primary ability of the Dark Lord, and what makes the Dark Lord the Ruler of Chaos.  
This ability allows you, like the Dark Lord, to use all the power and abilities of beings that you defeat in combat and/or kill, allowing you to absorb their souls and completely control them, thus gaining access to all of their abilities and power.  
The power itself is extremely dangerous to handle, as those not specifically prepared for its power aren't able to contain it, and thus die. However, this isn't a danger for you, for you are perfectly matched for the Power of Dominance.  
*The Dark Lord*  
Required:Castlevania (Castlevania)  
You are the new Dark Lord, also known as the Prince of Darkness or Demon King. As the Dark Lord, your will extends across all Devils/Demons, allowing you to bend the demonic spirits to your command.

This has enhanced your power of Dominance, making it so you no longer have to just defeat individuals in combat. Instead, you can now have individuals swear themselves to you, binding their souls to you and Castlevania, tying their very existence to your power. They become as much a part of you as Castlevania has become. This allows you to do as you please with them, such as giving them access to any abilities you or those bonded to Castlevania have, changing their form, reviving them if they are killed, or even erasing their very soul from existence. It's up to you.  
Your bond with Castlevania has become complete, making the Castle now an extension of you and your power. The Castle can freely change its form to suit your desires and control its interior dimensions as you wish.

Moreover, it can revive or recreate those in your power or service through the Castle if they die.  
You also gain the knowledge & experience of all previous Dark Lords.

Hellspawn (Image Comics)  
Cost: 35 SP  
You are a Hellspawn, a being that was formerly human but made a deal with a Lord of Hell for a favor and, in return, were used as an officer for their army. When a Hellspawn is created, their bodies are reforged and infused with a dark energy called Necroplasm. While most Hellspawn tend to look grotesque (and that's being nice), you will look as you currently do, only brought to peak physical condition, bonded with a sentient and constantly evolving neural parasite also made of Necroplasm, which takes the form of a suit linked directly to their host's central nervous system. Yours is a K-7 model, a stronger, more purebred, and adaptive variant, making you a stronger Hellspawn. The suit feeds on the souls of those it kills to enhance, adapt, and evolve itself in response to your needs, wants, desires, and the stimuli it encounters. The suit is able to shift itself into any form you need and can take on various weapon forms for combat, only really limited by your imagination. It feeds off the Necroplasm (or any other spiritual energy you possess) in your body to sustain itself. The suit will move on its own to protect you even when you are unconscious. The costume can also feed off evil energy from the physical world, feeding off the ambient evil of people, animals, and even certain parts of cities.

The combination of a Necroplasm body and Symbiote being much denser than your mortal body gives you greatly superhuman strength that can go toe to toe with high-level angels and demons, speed such that you can dodge light, durability, reflexes, etc.

The greatest ability of a Hellspawn is their vast magical powers, though limited by your power supply, (though this can be replenished with time or absorbing it from spiritual sources). Though the power source is finite, what you can do with it is only limited by your imagination. Some of the ways this magic has been used include resurrecting the dead, firing blasts of necroplasmic energy, teleportation, transmutation, elemental manipulation, shape-shifting, flight, talking to animals, invisibility, multidimensional portals , space-time manipulation, soul manipulation, reality warping, regeneration, feeding off the evil sins and negative energy to augment yourself and refill your reserves, Healing, phasing, psychic powers, telekinesis, cosmic awareness. The list goes on.

Another effect of this transformation is that you now contain 6000 lost souls called the Legion. These are the souls of those who died during the same hour that you were transformed. The power from these souls renders you uncontrollable by the lords of Hell. You can, with practice, learn to access their knowledge and experiences. You can also cause these souls to manifest themselves physically as Hellspawn, allowing them to appear and aid you in combat wherever you are. You can talk to these souls and free them by completing any unfinished business they have, and while this lowers the effective force of the Legion, the souls that choose to stay will become stronger and more tempered to battle, lowering the quantity but raising the quality of the Legion.  
Hellspawn are practically immortal unless beheaded by a weapon of heaven or by powerful magic. Though you can be rendered powerless (and therefore mortal) in "Dead Zones" small patches of Earth that are Heaven's domain. Also, you possess a degree of acausality, meaning that any changes to your past or future self will have no effect on the current you.  
Note that as time passes, Hellspawn only grow more powerful and dangerous.

Seraphim (Supernatural)  
Cost: 30 SP  
As a Seraphim, your spiritual form and voice will prove overwhelming to most mortals. It can cause effects such as burning eyes or bleeding eardrums. Your size has been described as "approximately the size of the Chrysler Building." When outside of a vessel and on the physical plane, you will appear to humans as either a brilliant white light or a bluish luminous smoke.  
Becoming a Seraphim has granted you a whole host of abilities, such as nigh-invulnerability (angels are immune to all forms of harm except Angel Blades, Holy Fire, and beings more powerful than themselves, such as Archangels, and Primordials). You also possess limited cosmic awareness, allowing you to have knowledge and awareness of certain topics in the universe, including demons, Enochian symbols and magic, spells, prayers, and all languages (dead or alive, written and spoken). Angelic senses and perception are incredibly enhanced, enabling you to recognize beings based on their body odour and genes, see atoms and ions, hear conversations from miles away, and taste every molecule in a meal. You can also see the true form of other angels, demons, and reapers, as well as sense the location of every being in the universe, except those protected by Enochian magic and those stronger than you who choose to hide and Teleporting wherever you senses reach. Furthermore, you possess limited chronokinesis, allowing you to travel through time, send others forward or backward through time, and manipulate time itself (e.g., freezing or speeding it up). However, repeated use of these abilities can be draining on your Grace. Additionally, you have a whole host of additional abilities, including reality warping, telepathy, telekinesis, high level healing & Biokinesis, advanced Dreamwalking, and the ability to hear prayers directed at you.  
You have also been given an Angel Blade and Sword. These weapons can be used to kill most supernatural beings by channelling your Grace/Soul against your opponents. However, they are unable to kill beings stronger than you, such as Archangels. If lost or stolen, you will always be able to call them back to you.  
Be aware that while within a vessel, angels only possess their powers thanks to their Grace. If your Grace is taken or drained, you become like a human, retaining only your angelic senses, while your Grace slowly regenerates. The regeneration process could take months or even years, depending on how much has been taken.

Shazam (DC Comics)  
Cost: 40 SP  
The Wizard Shazam has imbued you with the power of the Living Lightning. Saying the words "Shazam" changes you into your mental and physical peak, granting you your full potential; with children, this transforms them into an adult form.

The Wisdom of Solomon grants you instant access to knowledge and directly advises you on all things. You gain the ability to speak any language, an eidetic memory, and a vast intellect.

From The Strength of Hercules, you gain a level of strength that is only matched by the likes of Superman or Wonder Woman.

Mark of Cain (Mortal Instruments)  
Cost: 30 SP  
The Mark of the Wanderer now graces your brow. It is an ancient rune of protection, first used upon Cain as a divine punishment by God himself. This protection is truly impenetrable by anything short of an omnipotent being. Anyone attempting to, or succeeding at doing you harm will find their efforts returned upon them sevenfold.  
This reflected harm is conceptual in nature. A normal human might find their punch throwing them across the room with a broken arm. But a Demon Lord dealing a grievous blow will find themselves swiftly turned into a pillar of salt.  
Having been marked to wander eternally by God, you are immune to the ravages of time, and are completely incapable of doing yourself intentional harm.

Cosmo (Saint Seiya)  
Cost: 20 SP  
All Matter is made of atoms and thus is connected to the greater universal Cosmo. With this logic, you gain an inner universe within you. You may “Burn” via exploding it to generate Cosmo, an insanely powerful and nigh-limitless energy source.  
By Burning Cosmo one can vastly increase their strength, speed, stamina, mental abilities, and senses beyond imagination. However, Cosmo does not offer any increase in durability and in fact, can harm the user if they Burn too much Cosmo. When someone burns Cosmo they release a massive amount of heat acting as both a weapon and pseudo armor. With training, it is possible to generate other elements at extremely potent levels instead. Such as cold temperatures near absolute Zero at 6th sense and true zero with the 7th and beyond with higher Senses. Cosmo may be used as a projectile or solid light constructs, and may also generate elemental attacks and effects with the right training and knowledge. Cosmo also grants an extremely potent ability to manipulate atoms. This ability is generally used to destroy things at an atomic level but can also be used to create or change matter. Cosmo can also be used for Telekinesis, Telepathy, transformation, and anything given enough knowledge and training and a high enough Sense.

You begin with your 6th Sense unlocked and the strength of a Bronze Saint. Your Cosmo grants you strength equal to one ton of force and the ability to move at Mach one and possess the knowledge expected of a Bronze Saint in Cosmo usage.

You are also given a special armor known as a Cloth. Cloths are semi-sentient powerful artifacts that allow a Cosmo user to burn their Cosmo without strain and enhance your Cosmo and it will subtly assist them as it can. Cloths also have an Object Form which resembles a statue of whatever constellation it is named after. Each also comes with a Pandora Box which may repair superficial damage to a Cloth that is placed inside it.

Each Cloth can also come with a special ability. You may pick a single Bronze Cloth from Saint Seiya Canon or create your custom Cloth with a theme of your choice. A Bronze Cloth has durability able to withstand forces up to 4 tons and covers roughly half of its wearer's body. Lower-ranking clothes only cover part of the body but still slightly weaker protection to areas it does not cover. Only a Cosmo user can wear and use a Cloth as otherwise it is impossibly heavy.

Cosmo is broken into levels based on Senses with each more allowing one to further grasp reality and thus expand their Cosmos and ability to Burn their Cosmo.

The 6th Sense “Intuition” is unlocked when one can sense and begin training their Cosmo. Those who have unlocked their 6th Sense possess strength equal to 1-5 tons and the ability to move Mach 1-5. Bronze Saints possess abilities at the lower number while Silver Saints at the peak.

The 7th Sense “Miraculosity” is gained when one can grasp and connect to the Cosmo of the world around them. Those who have gained the seventh sense have strength anywhere from planetary to multi solar system and can move at the speed of light to start and can grow even faster. With extreme effort, one can travel to other local universes and realms.

The 8th sense “Arayashiki” can only be gained by being able to sense your soul either by almost dying and burning your Cosmo to the limit and beyond. Or through a long period of deep introspection and training. Those who have succeeded in unlocking the eighth sense transcend death and can exist as only a soul and rebuild their body at will. They possess strength able to destroy multiple solar systems at a minimum and may grow to multiversal with mastery and a powerful enough Cloth. Those with the 8th sense may move countless times faster than the speed of light and can travel the universe and with time multiverse at will.

The 9th sense Divinity or Supreme Virtue is attained upon reaching enlightenment and is nearly impossible to achieve. Those who reach this Sense become full Gods gaining apropiate domains that possess effectively limitless Strength and Speed. They also can freely manipulate reality with nearly no limits.  
Whispers speak of even higher Senses that are held by only the most ancient gods and immortals.

Solar Exalted (Exalted)  
Cost: 35 SP  
You are given a Solar Exaltation without the Great Curse & without age limits. You have the abilities of Solar during starting character creation.

As an Exalted, you have "Charms," supernatural abilities which make you unbelievably and magically exceptional at things that you do, such as being able to leap several miles or being able to write a speech so impressive you're appointed leader of a country without even running for office. Charms also give you conceptual attacks and defenses comparable to Heroic Spirits from Fate, with Perfect Parries being able to do things like Block Sting, and Unblockable Attacks being able to hit Contessa actively dodging you. Charms cost Essence, a resource you have a finite amount of per day, and must regenerate over time (usually while resting) or by doing something at least mildly impressive (called "Stunting" or "Stunts"). Using Essence from your Peripheral pool (ambient energy) rather than your Personal pool (internal energy) gives you an "Anima Flare" a bright anime power-up energy field that makes it obvious you're doing something supernatural, with the degree of the anima flare corresponding to the peripheral Essence spent.

As a Solar Exalted your abilities are focused on being "excellent," with your Charms focusing on taking abilities you (or humans in general) already have and dialing them up to 11, like being such a strong Martial Artist you can kill Endbringers, or having such a commanding and Charismatic presence you can convince supervillains to turn themselves in.  
Sorcery Unbound (Exalted)  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required: Solar Exalted (Exalted), Lunar Exalted (Exalted), Sidereal Exalted (Exalted), Alchemical Exalted (Exalted), Terrestrial Exalted (Exalted), or Exigent (Exalted)  
Sorcery and Necromancy, magical arts of great power with which Exalted of all stripes use to achieve miracles, going far beyond simple Charms. However, there is a catch to this; the two arts are incompatible with each other by default, advancement in one art inhibiting development in the other, and forcing Exalts to choose between mastering one, and mastering neither.  
No longer. Now, your proficiency in both Sorcery and Necromancy are transcendental, allowing you not only to master both arts without limit, but also allowing you to develop your mystical skills up to the Third Circle regardless of the strength of your Exaltation, even if you are but a Terrestrial. Furthermore, you are not necessarily limited to the mystical arts of Creation, either: If you had the knowledge and resources, you could learn the arts of the Man-Machine and God-Machine Protocols of the Alchemicals, or even the Glamour Sorceries of the Raksha.

Aasimar (D\&D)  
Cost: 10 SP  
You become infused by the planes and energies of pure goodness.  
This changes your body and soul, for one thing it makes you moderately ‘more’ than a normal human in just about every which way, it also makes you incredibly and supernaturally beautiful, although not in a seductive manner, your beauty being more akin to a sacred piece of art. This beauty is supernatural in that it is not only due to your physical traits but also a supernatural tendency amongst all that view you to find your traits incredibly beautiful. Your very soul also becomes a thing of incredible beauty and value. You gain an incredible affinity for all things of light and goodness, you can feel peoples prayers and channel pure positive energy to heal and banish evil and corruption. You will find it very hard to be anything other than good and just to the people around you, it will not be impossible, but you will find that it goes against your base instincts. You can also call weak angels and celestials from the heavens, who will grow stronger as you do, to help you every so often, the can also be from the retinue of any good aligned deity if you choose to have your heritage specifically from them. although your bloodline cannot come directly from any greater or middling deity, you being at least several generations removed from them. You are even able to read/write/speak the beautiful language known as Celestial.  
Your hair shines like metal, like pure heavenly gold if you are blond, and like the purest most sacred ruby if you have red hair, and so on. Your eyes also turn golden with a soft glow to them. You can at will turn off and on a radiant halo which appears around or behind your head and will buff and heal your allies, and the innocent who are hit by its light.  
Of All That is Good  
Cost: 25 SP  
Required:Aasimar (D\&D)  
You embody light, life, and goodness in all it’s forms. Exquisite flowers bloom where you step and your light chases away evil, depression and all things commonly thought of as bad. You can see the sins of every living thing you can gaze at. Your halo evolves and no innocent can be harmed or hurt as long as its light reaches them, you can heal just about anything other than death away in the blink of an eye, and looking at you is now akin to a religious experience. You gain massive control and power over holy sun fire, spawning it and controlling it at will, choosing what and who it can hurt. Your presence is a balm to the soul chasing away depression and other such mental or spiritual afflictions of all that surround you, you gain an infinite lifespan as while you are still a mortal you now have more in common with other celestials such as angels than a normal human. You can every week resurrect one person fully and completely, but be very careful doing so, you might just take a soul out of heaven and their eternal paradise, and that is a very, very cruel thing to do. You can feel people that are in harms way and appear near them in order to help them, this feeling extends to about the size of New York city in a circle around you. You also gain a pair of functional angel wings.  
All these powers can be turned on and off at will or be dialled up and down as you please.  
Your comprehension of the Celestial language also increases. The Words of Creation were fragments of the precursor of the Celestial language. This precursor language, known as Supernal, was said to be the tongue of the gods themselves. Able to be understood by any sentient mind. And now you know a few of those words, able to learn more with time.

Ki (Dragon Ball Series)  
Cost: 20 SP  
You now posses the knowledge and the requisite skills to effectively utilize and cultivate the potent force known as Ki to its utmost potential. Ki, the life force that permeates the essence of every living entity, through the process of extraction, can be manipulated and harnessed beyond the confines of your physical form.

The versatility of Ki cannot be overstated. It serves to enhance both the body and spirit, refining your proficiency with martial arts and propelling them to unprecedented levels, creating techniques from sealing, to powering up your stats, and even teleportation, its utilization is bound solely by the limits of your imagination. The magnitude of your reservoir of Ki corresponds directly to the potency of your physical constitution, thus the more powerful your body is, the more you are able to draw upon this life force.

However, this process usually takes considerable time, effort and proper guidance to sustain. The rewards, though, are boundless, as Ki growth possesses the capacity for infinite expansion. Advancing along this path becomes progressively more arduous as you ascend to greater heights.

To facilitate the journey towards your Ki cultivation, a comprehensive manual is directly installed to your brain and can be accessed at any time. It meticulously outlines a step-by-step progression and provides explicit instructions for the diligent practitioner to follow, ensuring continued advancement and proficiency in the art of Ki manipulation as long as one remains dedicated to this pursuit.  
*Kaio-ken*  
Required:Eight Gates Technique (Naruto)  
You have been given the ability and skill with the Kaio-Ken. Originally made by King Kai, this technique grants one the ability to multiply their overall power of their basic capabilities, granting one the ability to increase their strength two times. Your skill with it, however, is enough for you to multiple up to ten times, but beware as the Kaio-Ken puts an immense strain on the body if you are unable to handle the multiplier. You do, however, possess the skill to use it without much strain when going times five. One of the greatest benefits of this technique, besides allowing you to increase your power to fight against those of above your original full might, is that the greater your handling of higher multipliers, the greater your Ki Control. Should you purchase the Spirit Control Upgrade your multiplier for the technique will be times fifteen.

Sacred Gear Engineer (DxD)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:The Craftsman  
Required:Holy Light (DxD)  
You obtained the knowledge and skills to construct artificial Sacred Gears, rivalling the leader of the fallen angels, Azazel. These are powerful soulbound artefacts that can be summoned by their wielder, granting them unique powers. This includes the ability to both extract them from their current hosts and implant them into new ones by yourself without requiring a Sacred Gear extractor or killing their current host.  
Most of the powerful Sacred Gears are designed to have a being sealed in them as their source of power and abilities, so this power also grants you knowledge of appropriate sealing techniques that were used by the God of the Bible for this purpose.

Artificial Sacred Gears are inferior to the real ones, having several limits and side effects. For example, after some time has passed, an artificial Sacred Gear can cause fatigue after their usage and may affect both the powers and abilities of the wielder if said wielder uses them for long periods of time. But with further research and mastery, these drawbacks can be removed, and it is possible to create true Sacred Gears.

In the beginning, you will be limited to more basic ones like the Applause Wall, which is capable of making strong barriers; the Scouting Persona, which can create floating masks designed for surveillance; or even the more basic original Sacred Gears, like a Twice Critical, which is a gauntlet capable of doubling the power of the user for a certain time.  
But you can also modify normal artefacts, including objects of power, to act like a Sacred Gear, including the possibility to develop new sub-species powers and even a Balance Breaker state. Or even upgrade and rebuild the original Sacred Gears with sufficient research, with the potential to even create a new Longinus.

Deus Mechanicus  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Deus Est Machina (40k)  
Required:Sacred Gear (DxD)  
Your Sacred Gear has merge with your power over technology, and becoming a unique sub-species of the Longinus Sacred Gear "Unknown Dictator" which holds dominion over the very concept of Technology and Progress, allowing it to tap into the boundless potential of innovation and invention. At its core resides a Machine God, an ancient entity hailing from the enigmatic Evie race—a civilization of god-like robots.

The base ability of the Unknown Dictator is to seize control and reshape any technology or object within its vicinity. Unfettered by the constraints of reality, the wielder's imagination and available materials become the only limits to their creations. Through a mere thought, the wielder can transform a decrepit, rusted machine into a marvel of engineering from a distant, futuristic epoch.

With a wave of your hand, an abandoned truck's exterior would gleams with ethereal luminescence, masking its presence from prying eyes using advanced cloaking technology. The mundane engine within vanishes, replaced by an ethereal anti-gravity drive, enabling it to soar through the skies like a majestic bird. The driver's seat molds into a plush cockpit, assimilating an AI capable of autonomous decision-making, making self-driving a mere child's play.

The Unknown Dictator's influence extends beyond mere technological transformations. When the wielder stands at the helm of a battlefield, any equipment within their grasp is imbued with an otherworldly aura. Bullets hum with unprecedented accuracy, their trajectory molded to perfection. Shields fortify themselves with an energy barrier, absorbing the impact of even the most fearsome onslaughts.

Yet, the true marvel of the Unknown Dictator lies in its potential for evolution. As the wielder unlocks newfound depths of creativity and understanding, the Machine God within the sacred gear slowly awakens and merges with their very being. With each new creation, the wielder existence is slowly elevated, walking the path to become the Omnissiah, the True God of Machines, Technology's, Progress, Inventions, and Innovations.

Star God (40k)  
Cost: 25 SP  
Required:Cryptek (40k)  
You are now a C'tan Shard, a miniscule fraction of a being that once made the Old Ones quake with fear. You have an unparalleled ability to manipulate matter and energy, comparable to the T2 power Omni-Kinesis without range limits. Your body is made of an extremely durable Necrodermis shell, allowing you to shapeshift and granting you a powerful healing factor. This power will only grow in time, eventually leading to you becoming a full C'tan, a being comparable in many ways to a Negentropic Entity.

Necrons (40k)  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Cryptek (40k)  
You can now synthesize and create the sentient xenos machine species known as the Necrons.

Utilizing a specialized living metal called Necrodermis, you can breath to life various types of Necrons, ranging from frontline troops like warriors to even overlords and phaeron, and everything in between. This also encompasses Necron constructs like Canoptek Spyders, Destroyers, and even Wraiths. You have within you the power to breathe life into Necrons with such perfection that even the Silent King's body, crafted by the C'tan themselves, would pale in comparison.

Naturally, the larger and more powerful the creation, the greater the quantity of Necrodermis required, though you possess an inherent awareness of the necessary amounts for each creation.

To obtain Necrodermis, you can transmute regular metals into it when in proximity to that metal. Conductive metals will yield a superior ratio of transmuted Necrodermis. For instance, 1 kilo of silver will grant you 1 kilo of Necrodermis, whereas 1 kilo of stainless steel will only produce 500 grams of the living metal. You can transmute 1 kilo of Necrodermis if you have the equivalent ratio of the appropriate conductive metal within one-tenth of a second.

To the Necrons and your other creations, you are the unchallenged sovereign, your word a law they are bound to uphold. This allegiance is unwavering, transcending distinctions of intelligence, awareness, and inherent nature. Regardless of their complexity, each and every one of the entities you have brought into being, along with those subsequently birthed from your creations, is innately aware of your sovereign authority. They are instinctively and unfailingly devoted to fulfilling your commands, bound by an unbreakable perfect loyalty that endures throughout their eternal existence.

You have the option to impart the full technology and knowledge of the Necron eternal empire to your Necrons, from their absolute peak at the war in heaven to their current state, either partially or fully, according to your discretion.

The Necrons are genuinely immortal, possessing the ability to regenerate from any injury given enough time. However, as their creator, you have the power to instantly terminate any of them whenever you want, by simply reclaiming the life spark you granted them, reducing them to inert Necrodermis metal.

C'tan Shards (40k)  
Cost: 35 SP  
Required:Necrons (40k)  
The C'tan, once revered as gods, embodied the sheer might of the universe in the form of nearly omnipotent sentient beings. However, those days have long passed, and the gods have been vanquished, shattered into thousands of shards by their own servitors the necrons. These shards, each locked away and concealed, harbor the immeasurable power of the C'tan.

Even now in their reduced and wholly fettered state, C'tan Shards are beings of near-unlimited power. They can manifest energy blasts, control the minds of lesser beings, manipulate the flow of time, and banish foes to alternate dimensions. Indeed, a C'tan Shard's abilities are limited only by two things: its imagination \-- which is immense \-- and glimmering memories of the being from which it was severed. Whilst no individual C'tan Shard has full recall of the omnipotent being it once was, each carries the personality and hubris of that vaster and more puissant being.

Now, you possess the keys to unleash and use every C'tan shard held by the Necrons, in an alternative dimension only you can access. The Necrons had only unleashed these god like beings in the most dire circumstances, fearing that, despite the failsafes and precautions in place, there remained a small chance however remote for the shards to escape and attempt to overthrow their captors, reclaiming their position once again as the rulers of the universe. However, you share not this concern, as these shards like your Necron creations, will exhibit perfect loyalty to you, offering their overwhelming power in eternal servitude.

Required:Adeptus Mechanicus (40k)

You have become a living version of this ancient masterwork, able to perfectly calculate everything needed to create from locally-available materials the means of manufacture and assemble every single advancement Mankind has ever made, from simple tinderboxes to the means of re-igniting cold stars.

At the height of understanding, Mankind built power generation modules that could harness the galactic background radiation to propel ships beyond light-speed, weapons that could crack open planets, aethermatic formulas to mold brane shields for shunting ships into different universes, specialized Gellar fields to seal or vivisect daemons, cure all possible or conceivable ailments or diseases with the Panacea, craft event horizon machines to digitize space-time or drag entire star systems into naked singularities, & even heal people by reversing time; the galaxy almost seems limited & quaint with the power of a full STC.

Cost: 40 SP  
You are a Time Lord in your first incarnation, this new physiology and relatively unique position provides various abilities. Time Lords have 13 incarnations, each one having a full lifespan of several centuries, unless ended early by violence or other factors. When an incarnation ends, barring the final one, a Time Lord will Regenerate, completely restoring them, with their 'age' reset, and with a brand new personality and appearance; Many things such as sex, gender, and what have you can change in this process. They are the same person underneath it all, but expressed through the lens of their current incarnation. What sets you apart from most Time Lords is that you have complete control over the details of your regenerations, enabling you to retain your current personality and appearance if you choose to do so. Every 120 years, your Regeneration Cycle resets, replenishing your remaining charges back to 12 as you do not need the Time Lord Council to grant you more.  
As a multidimensional being with an affinity towards and psychic resonance with the dimension of Time, you exert a subtle and unconscious influence on the universe. Nothing truly powerful, just a little bit of luck here, or being just in the right place to handle a crisis there. The chakras of your nervous system can feel the texture of the time vortex and allow you to feel temporal anomalies, noticing alterations as sudden gut revulsion is a common synesthesia. You're undeniably brilliant by human standard, but about average for a Time Lord, and retain the truly staggering education Time Lord society offers its members; you have what amounts to multiple human lifetimes’ worth of schooling, covering broad swathes of skills and nearly encyclopedic knowledge. Your particular exposure to the Time Vortex has placed the information to recreate any technology from the Doctor Who series in your mind.

Your strength and durability are mildly superhuman, your respiratory system can retain much more air and even protect you from the void of space for brief periods. There's two hearts in your chest, increasing your cardiovascular load, while your body both resists and filters out radiation to a rather high degree, as it is a significant danger when travelling through space and time. You can even enter a healing coma, tuning your outward metabolism down far enough to emulate death while internally your body goes into overdrive to heal most severe non-fatal injuries at an accelerated pace. Finally, there are a myriad of other unique minor physiological tricks that generally serve to give you an edge in whatever the latest crisis you find yourself in.

Tenseigan (Naruto)

This chakra mode is strong enough to allow a relatively weak member of the Ōtsutsuki Clan to briefly fight with a perfect, mature full ninetails jinchūriki; in your hands, its abilities will truly shine. The default color of the chakra mode is cyan, but you are free to choose a different color.

*Energy Vessel*

The vessel's impressive control over gravity will even allow for stabilising the hollowing out of the moon, making the interior habitable, or even changing the very orbit to send the moon on a path of your choosing. The vessel can power puppets and other automatons, and can project a barrier that makes it difficult to be found by those who lack awareness of it to begin with.

While anything would need to be in your field to allow this ability to affect them, living things only need to be partially inside your field in order for you to affect them. i.e. if you were to have someone send an avatar, you'd hit their real body as soon as the avatar stepped foot in your range.

Each of these effects can be applied to either your body, jutsu, weapons, or others but only one effect can be applied to one thing at a time but all three effects can be applied individually to different things. You can also choose to partially imbue something with an effect allowing the rest of it to be affected by another effect. i.e. you could imbue your body with Yata no Kagami except your arm which you could choose to imbue with Kusanagi no Tsurugi for example.  
The Kusanagi no Tsurugi, grants anything you imbue the ability to kill anything with a single strike, from the smallest cut to the fatalist strike, from something as simple as a leaf to a bullet to a jutsu. Provided it hits what you intended it will kill.  
The Yata no Kagami, grants anything you imbue the ability to be completely impervious to damage from something as blinding light to disease or aging. Nothing can harm what is protected by the mirror.  
The Yasakani no Magatama, grants anything you imbue the ability to immediately and guarantee to travel and if you choose it, to hit it regardless of any defenses in its way. Although this does nothing for the durability of the thing your hitting, it merely ensures it will hit.  
*Tamanooya*

The consumption of the fruit has revealed to you the innate properties of the sacred imperial treasures. A blade that always kills, ensuring an exact effect. A mirror that always protects, ensuring a denial of an effect. A jewel that always hits, ensuring an exact set of cause. Your treasures were inscribed with the power to manipulate causality itself, a skill that you now possess as well. You are now able to apply any of your treasures in any combination to anything at once. You are still limited to only utilizing it one at a time, however, this is no longer a hard limit as with time you may learn to freely manipulate causality, an incredibly dangerous power.

You can focus your vision on anything within the range of your Byakugan, and can penetrate nearly any object, being able to see through walls, underground, or even the contents of someone's body. You can see chakra to a greater extent than someone with a Sharingan, including the 361 tenketsu points along someone's chakra pathway.

The Byakugan's ability to see chakra grants increased resistance to falling under genjutsu, but doesn't completely remove the risk. They can, however, be used to increase the effectiveness of your own genjutsu.

These eyes operate without expending any energy, and suffer from no strain or fatigue from prolonged and uninterrupted use, wield them as you wish.

*Ancestral Byakugan*

Rinnegan (Naruto)  
Cost: 20 SP  
The Eyes of God are yours now. The Rinnegan’s name might sound overly grandiose, but be assured, it is not. You have these eyes now, along with all the powers that come with them.  
These take the form of multiple ‘paths’, each with its own abilities. You can use all of these powers in one body if you want, but you can also use multiple bodies, one for each path. Each path has it’s own theme as well as two passive effects that are always active. Where it would matter these things stack with and augment any such affinities, control, or reserves you already possess.  
First of all you have the Deva Path, which grants you control over the physical world and its fundamental forces. You will start out with instinctive control over gravity but as you practice more and more of the physical world will fall under your purview. This path’s passive buffs are, exceptional affinities in all five normal elements and the ability to freely mix whatever elements you can manipulate.

The second path is the Asura Path. This path gives you dominion over your own body, allowing you to manipulate and transmute it in whatever way you desire. You can create metal, transmute your body into a cyborg and back, or even heal yourself freely. Whatever is generated from your body can transmit your chakra, even when it is no longer connected to your body. This Path’s first passive buff is an incredibly powerful body and vitality granting exceptional Yang chakra, and a monstrous chakra capacity, either half the size of the Jūbi’s or double your own, whatever is greater.  
The Human Path grants you dominion over the mind and souls of people, including your own. You can manipulate them and interact with them directly, so much so that you could even extract their memories from them with just a touch. This Path’s passive buffs are an increased mental acuity granting exceptional Yin Chakra, and extremely fine control over your chakra.  
The Animal Path, the fourth path, grants you access to summoning. Any being that you personally defeat and/or kill can be summoned by you. However you are not limited to this and will over time learn to summon anything and everything, such as summoning the souls and bodies of people who have long since died, or even creating portals to summon yourself elsewhere. This Path’s passive buff is that any trials or requirements to get summons are smoothed over due to this, and the ability to summon anything that is considered “yours” to your person at any time.  
The Preta Path allows you to absorb anything and everything from your surroundings, even from other people or techniques headed at you. You can not only absorb this, but convert it to chakra so you can add it to your own reserves, even to the extent of increasing your overall pool to a reduced extent. This Path’s passive buffs is an innate ability to analyze and break down the structure and knowledge of anything you absorb, and an incredibly adaptive chakra system allowing you to replicate the properties and characteristics of whatever you absorb.  
The Naraka Path grants dominion over the metaphysical and the underlying fundamentals of reality. You’ll start off with instinctive control over life and death, allowing at the start to repair the bodies of living things or even, at an immense chakra cost, resurrect the dead. This path will require the usage of other paths to channel it’s abilities through, but over time will allow you to use it just through this. This path’s passive buffs are an instinctive understanding of reality, and the ability to directly interact with the forces you’ve gained control over.  
These eyes operate without expending any energy, and suffer from no strain or fatigue from prolonged and uninterrupted use, wield them as you wish.

All Seeing Eyes of God (Blood Blockade Battlefront/Kekkai Sensen)

The eyes can also be used to track body parts that have been removed or extracted from a person even when it cannot normally be traced by conventional means simply by viewing the aura of the person and matching it with said body part.  
The eyes do have their limits, however. Prolonged use of the eyes' abilities causes them to heat up to the point where they will start burning the user. If the eyes are damaged enough, they will crack, making their powers unusable until they heal back again. Do beware many entities may not like you seeing the Truth about them.

Shadow Monarch (Solo Levelling)  
Cost: 25 SP

As the Monarch of Shadows, Ruler of the Dead you are capable of extracting the Shadows of the dead, though there’s a chance of failure if the being is significantly stronger than you or had been dead for a long time. Three attempts may be made on the same being before you can no longer attempt to extract their Shadow.

While Shadows start slightly weaker than when they were alive, they gradually get stronger the more they kill and can eventually evolve into greater beings.

Additionally, you can use your shadow to store items.

The Golden Army (Hellboy)  
Cost: 20 SP  
The Golden Army, also known as the "Unstoppable Force," was a formidable clockwork army consisting of 4,900 mechanical warriors, each towering over humans in both size and strength. These mechanical soldiers, forged by goblin blacksmiths with ancient magic and unparalleled craftsmanship, were designed to be self-repairing, making them virtually indestructible. No matter the damage inflicted upon them, they would reassemble themselves, returning to battle with undiminished power. They were capable of devastation beyond imagination. Humans were no match for the sheer strength, durability, and relentless nature of these mechanical soldiers. A single soldier could cleave through dozens of men in one sweep, and entire battalions fell in moments beneath their crushing weight. No weapon could pierce their armor, no tactic could slow them. Their relentless, tireless nature made them a force feared by all who opposed them.

Commissioned by King Balor during the ancient wars between the mythical races and mankind, the Golden Army was created as the ultimate weapon to crush humanity. However, after witnessing the devastation and the toll of war, Balor's conscience led him to lock the army away, fearing that such immense power would corrupt anyone who wielded it. Hidden deep within an impenetrable vault, the Golden Army lay dormant, awaiting a new master.

Now, with the keys to their vault in your hands, you have been given command over this unstoppable army. You were given the Crown of Bethmora, giving you command over the army. Their mechanical eyes flicker to life at your command, and the earth trembles as 4,900 indestructible warriors rise to serve you. Be wary as any with Royal Blood can challenge you for your crown, and this control over your army.

The True Cloak of Invisibility (Harry Potter)  
Cost: 10 SP  
The True cloak of invisibility was once a part of Death's own cloak. With this, so long as you remain covered, you are invisible to all mortals, but still visible to those that have already died. It is virtually indestructible, can shrink or enlarge to cover up to three people, and will never lose its potency. However, it is not infallible. People can still detect you via non-optical means, and while the cloak itself is indestructible, it doesn't offer this boon to you.  
*Master of Death*  
Required: The Elder Wand (Harry Potter)  
Required: The Resurrection Stone (Harry Potter)  
You accepted your mortality. As Master of Death, you understand that Death is part of life, and while it doesnt make you suicidal or reckless in any way, you are in peace with it.  
You become biologically ageless, becoming younger and older at will. You know when death is coming to others, and can offer to let them have a peaceful death, and guide them to their afterlife. You gain an affinity for spells related to life and death, and know when someone cheated death. Whatever you kill, it becomes impossible to bring back.  
The Relics now recognize only you as their master, and will only work for others if you lend or give it to them.  
*Shroud of Death*  
Required:Reaper of Souls  
As the personification of Death itself, the true power of the Invisibility Cloak is revealed to you.  
The Cloak can take the form of any clothing you desire and is capable of perfectly concealing you from all things, even the dead. The cloak covers more than just visible means of detection, concealing your scent and deafening your movements. It can even shield you from passive magic, allowing you to pass through complex and powerful wards as if they didn’t exist. If you so desire then you can turn off the concealment or even have it only selectively hide you from certain people.  
However, there is an even further level of concealment available to you. When you actively channel magic into the Cloak it goes a step further and conceals you from the universe itself, allowing you to phase through anything, even magic. You are an ethereal, a silent but omnipresent wraith.

The Elder Wand (Harry Potter)  
Cost: 10 SP  
The Elder Wand is one of the three Deathly Hallows, and you have become its master. This wand will always be loyal to you and you alone, significantly amplifying any magic it casts. You can make charms and transfigurations permanent, and charms become more potent. In a duel, you will almost always emerge victorious against someone weaker than you, but you will be challenged when it comes to someone of equal or greater strength.  
*Scythe of Death*  
Required:Reaper of Souls  
As the personification of Death itself, the true power of the Elder Wand is revealed to you.  
The Wand can take the form of any weapon or focus you desire and serves as the perfect conduit and focus for all of your powers. The boost to magic you cast extends to all powers channeled through the Wand, and the boost is further amplified when channeling abilities related to life and death. Furthermore, all abilities related to life and death have their costs drastically reduced when channeled through the Wand, to the point of being effectively free to use.  
The mastery of magic the Wand bestows upon you has ingrained itself into your soul, making the usage of all forms of magic and other supernatural energies much smoother for you. Your power effortlessly flows within you and seems almost eager to follow your command, providing an intuitive understanding of the intricacies of your own spells.

Cost: 5 SP  
The Resurrection Stone is one of the three Deathly Hallows, and it is a magical object that can summon the spirits of those who have passed away. You need to hold the stone and turn it three times in your hand to use it. Once you do this, the spirits will appear translucent, and you can communicate with them or give them instructions. However, it's important to remember that those who return to life through the stone do not belong in the world of the living, and it's essential to allow them to return to their resting place.  
*Will of Death*  
Required:Reaper of Souls  
As the personification of Death itself, the true power of the Resurrection Stone is revealed to you.  
The Stone has merged with your body, suffusing your essence with its power. With a mere thought you can call forth the spirits of the dead, effortlessly manifesting them in the real world. These spirits may be granted semi or even fully corporeal bodies if you so desire, allowing them to more actively carry out your will. Additionally, no force may bar you from calling a spirit and restoring it to life, the Stone serving as a form of absolute Authority.  
The Authority of the Stone now extends to all forms of the dead, not just the spirits you conjure yourself. This allows you to issue absolute orders to all forms of the dead, orders which can only be contested by a being of similar status as yourself.

Irminsul (Genshin Impact)  
Cost: 20 SP  
You have gained something incredible: the seedling of Irminsul, the world tree of Teyvat.

Once planted, the seedling will begin to assimilate into the fabric of reality of whichever world it is placed in. Its roots will start absorbing energy, memory, and information from the world to grow the tree.  
Besides absorbing memory, the roots will also become the new leyline system of that world, generating and regulating the flow of elemental energy within the land.  
If there is already a leyline system in the world, it will slowly be assimilated into the root system. From then on, the form of energy flowing through the original system will also be generated and regulated by Irminsul.  
As the one who planted the tree, you are granted a special connection to it, allowing you to access its repository of information and harness the energy generated by its roots to fuel whatever power you may have.  
Beware that particularly hazardous energy or information, such as forbidden knowledge or eldritch truths, will be harder for the tree to record and integrate into its system. This will cause dangerous anomalies to appear in the world until the tree adapts to such energy/knowledge and everything is incorporated.  
*Irminsul Avatar*  
Required:Archon (Genshin Impact)  
As an elemental god, your connection to Irminsul has been significantly strengthened. Like Nahida, your consciousness is now directly linked to and in control of the tree.  
This grants you the ability not only to access but also to alter the information stored within the tree, thereby changing the perception of everyone around you and historical records according to the new information. However, be aware that any being free from the influence of fate or those with a will strong enough to rival an entire world cannot have their memories altered by this capability.  
You can also control the roots of Irminsul and, consequently, the leyline system, allowing you to cause natural disasters at will or terraform the environment as you see fit.  
Additionally, any supernatural energy you possess will now be generated and regulated by the root system.  
*Fantasy Tree (Type-Moon)*  
Required:Old Magic (Type-Moon)  
Thanks to your ability to use magic from the age of gods, your Irminsul seedling has taken on the trait of the fantasy tree that sustains a Lostbelt.  
The tree now recognizes you as its King and grants you great authority to shape the world wherever its influence reaches.  
These powers grow in strength as the tree forcefully integrates itself into the fabric of reality wherever it is planted, becoming an integral part of the world and imposing its rule over it.  
*New Yggdrasil*  
Required:Archon (Genshin Impact)  
Required:Mythos (Final Fantasy XVI)  
Required:Dragon  
As a Dragon Sovereign and lord of the elements, your absolute control over elemental forces has caused Irminsul to evolve beyond its original limits. It has transformed from a mere part of the world into a framework designed to gestate new worlds.  
Initially, Irminsul will have gestated only one world at its heart, equivalent in size to our solar system. The fundamental foundation of this world will be elemental energy, along with any other form of energy you possess.

As the world continues to develop and flourish with life, the tree will convert the generated memory and information into energy. This energy will be used both to fuel the growth of the world and to begin the gestation of new worlds.

This process will create a feedback loop. As more worlds are created, new life will form, bringing more memory and experience to further fuel the growth of additional worlds.  
In time, Irminsul might even come to rival the Imaginary Tree, with each of the countless branches in its canopy being a universe in its own right. However, this is in the far future, millions if not billions of years away from the humble single world it has now.  
*Gaia Reborn*  
Required:The Moon Cell Automaton (Type-Moon)  
By incorporating the Moon Cell into itself, Irminsul has not only gained all of its capabilities and functions but has also grown tremendously thanks to the 4.6 billion years of data and records provided by the Moon Cell.

This growth has allowed Irminsul to create an exact replica of planet Earth, complete with all its textures and inhabitants, as it existed in Type-Moon, within a reality marble.  
Your connection to the tree grants you the privilege to wield any form of mystery that has ever existed on Type-Moon Earth, including but not limited to every form of magecraft, psychic power, magic from the Age of Gods, true magic, and divine authority.  
If you also have the Irminsul avatar add-on, you will become an existence similar to the will of the planet Gaia and Alaya, giving you full access to a Counter Force and a Throne of Heroes of your own.  
*Tree of Feelings*  
Required: Essence of Darkness (Undertale), or Essence of Light (Undertale)  
Your affinity for Positivity or Negativity has mutated your Irminsul Sapling into something more, flowering with the beginnings of “apples” which are manifestations of pure Emotion.  
While they aren’t ready yet, as your sapling matures so too do the blooms which grow there until they eventually bear fruit. If you possess Essence of Darkness your tree grows Black Apples of Negativity, while Essence of Light would have it grow Golden Apples of Positivity.  
Once the apples are mature you can pluck and eat them, empowering you on a fundamental level as the energy within is absorbed, enhancing your connection with your Emotion. Should you eat 200 apples then you could achieve a connection comparable to the Avatar of Negativity/Avatar of Positivity upgrades.  
Lastly, everywhere your tree has influence it spreads and reinforces the emotions you hold an affinity for, empowering you within its domain. In fact, should you possess both Essence of Darkness and Essence of Light then you can actively manage the emotional influence, selectively targeting some areas with increased Negativity while increasing Positivity everywhere else.

Noah's Ark (D Gray-man)  
Cost: 30 SP  
Noah's Ark is a mysterious white city, separated from the rest of reality. Originally, it was a tool used by the Noah Family in their war against Innocence, but somehow it has fallen into your hands.

As the new owner, you possess the power to control every aspect of the Ark—the layout, appearance, destination, and even its resting place. By simply willing it and playing the piano at the Ark's center, you can open white, jagged, numbered gates to any location within the multiverse you inhabit. Should you choose, you can also switch the Ark’s connection to a different multiverse. Access through these gates is restricted to only those you trust.

The Ark contains extra-dimensional spaces known as "rooms," which can range from entire ecosystems to vast tracts of land. When you open a gate, a corresponding number appears above doors in a central hub, allowing for quick and easy travel.

With time, you will gain the ability to control the Ark without needing to play the piano. Additionally, if you possess a power that creates a universe or some type of world tree, Noah's Ark will become the center of that power.

The Ark has enough space to support a self-sustaining civilization and comes with a loyal Clan of Noah, reminiscent of the original 14 Noah, including characters like Road, Tyki Mikk, and Lulu Bell.

Death's Sickles (Dreamworks)  
Cost: 15 SP  
With a whistle on the wind you find yourself with a pair of sickles, at first glance they seem quite normal with a few features such as extending shafts that combine together and blades able to lock into place at different angles allowing you to use them like sickles, blade knuckles and double headed scythes.  
However; there is a power within. A sense of finality. For these are Death's Tool. Not metaphorically, or poetically, or some fancy title or name given by a couple of no names and those forgotten in a few generations. These tools belong to Death.

As such these sickles possess a power that makes them quite formidable, able to bypass exoteric protections such as fate that would prevent these blades from claiming their prey, multiple forms of immortality and even able to neutralize special forms of healing such as magic leaving a target with only normal healing to work with. Not even hiding will do them any good as these tools can track targets but only one at a time. On the bright side for them these wounds will not be infected as the lingering powers of death leaves the wounds clean of plague and pests.  
However; there is another more frightening power to these tools. The closer a target has been to death and how assured in their own invincibility the more powerful these tools and you become. With sickle in hand you can make even the mightiest of heroes turn tail and run, almost as if Death itself was hunting them.

While the boost is centred around how close the target has been to death it does gain minor boosts based on the target, how confident in their own invincibility, their fear for their mortality and how their being and actions pervert the natural course of things.  
In the garden of life you are the gardener, ready to prune the trees and cut the excess to ensure a healthy garden. Although there is another in the garden who tends to whistle, nothing to worry about as it's merely an old friend.​

The Necronomicon (Cthulhu Mythos)  
Cost: 20 SP  
You are the possessor of an alternate dimensional grimoire known as the True Necronomicon, a sentient and boundless tome of occult knowledge. With its pages continually expanding, it serves as a repository for an ever-growing wealth of esoteric wisdom. Unlike the limited version of its copies, this book grants you the ability to inscribe new laws into the fabric of reality. The intricate rituals within invoke the power of the Eldritch, enabling you to shape and redefine the very nature of the world you inhabit.  
While the True Necronomicon's form and size can adapt to suit your needs, it typically manifests as a weighty tome. Although the Necronomicon lacks an index or search feature, its sentience compensates for this limitation. Its inherent understanding of your intentions ensures that you are directed to the precise information you desire or need at any given moment. It also possesses a passive perception filter that protects readers from descending into complete insanity while delving into its unfathomable depths. It's worth noting, however, that this filter applies universally, and the book contains the works of myriad authors in an array of languages, including many that are non-human.  
Through highlighting certain words, the Necronomicon can communicate directly with you, ensuring that you always find the relevant knowledge or guidance you require. This unique communication method enhances your interaction with the tome, enabling a more seamless and efficient exploration of its boundless contents.  
Should you desire, the True Necronomicon can assimilate other spellbooks, tomes of lore, and occult knowledge, incorporating their contents into its ever-expanding compendium.  
*The Lovebound Grimoire*  
Required:Sucker For Love  
With your grasp, the Necronomicon has transformed into the Lovebound Grimoire, an otherworldly tome brimming with forbidden knowledge and secrets with the purpose of guiding you to summon and date eldritch gods. Its boundless pages now hold tips, guidance, and knowledge on how to best establish relationships with these enigmatic beings.  
(Note: The Lovebound Grimoire retains all previous functions and knowledge from the Necronomicon, this just updates its contents)

Graviton Beam Emitter (Blame\!)  
Cost: 15 SP  
The Graviton Beam Emitter (GBE) takes the form of an ordinary handgun, distinguished by a cross-shaped energy indicator at the gun's rear.  
Upon activation, the GBE emits a broad, perfectly cylindrical red beam capable of obliterating almost anything in its trajectory. While it hints at gravity-manipulation technology, the intricacies of its functioning have been lost to time, rendering reverse engineering impossible.  
The GBE fires condensed unknown energy, with the beam emitted literally pushing away the atoms of whatever is in its path; the pushed atoms crashing back together cause large explosions, creating additional damage than the initial gravity beam.  
It can be discharged in two modes: either by individually pulling the trigger for rapid shots or by holding the trigger longer to generate a charged shot with a larger, extended energy beam.  
\- Level 1 requires almost no charge and can be fired rapidly. At this level, the range of the weapon is 70 km.  
\- Level 2 requires several seconds of charge and is notably more powerful, creating massive holes in its target. If you can fire the gun on level 1 with minimum recoil, you are knocked backwards from the force of the kickback.  
\- Level 4, the weapon will actually open up. In this state the recoil is so powerful and instantaneous that it will actually tear off the limb holding it.  
Due to its substantial recoil, firing it beyond level 1 is ill-advised for regular humans, with a level 5 strongly discouraged even for an Endbringer.  
(Tsutomu Nihei has stated that the effects of the weapon are so powerful that if it were to ever be fired at its strongest from Earth's surface, it would have devastating effects on the climate and atmosphere of the planet itself.)

Ascalon/The Sword of Azmuth (Ben 10\)  
Cost: 40 SP  
Ascalon was conceived by Azmuth in his pursuit to harness the fundamental forces of the universe, with the intent to "cleave right through" and reshape reality. The First Thinker succeeded in his ambitions, forging a weapon of immense, incomprehensible power. With each strike, Ascalon rends apart the fabric of space and time, bending the laws of existence to the wielder's desires, reshaping the world as they see fit.  
As the chosen wielder of Ascalon, you are bestowed with its phenomenal cosmic power. Acknowledged as its sole master, Ascalon will bar others from wielding it. By invoking its essence, you can channel vast amounts of energy, empowering yourself and even reversing the weathering of age, restoring you to your prime while unlocking its extraordinary capabilities.  
You can then, at will, summon an all-encompassing armor of your choosing, unrestricted by the appearance depicted in the series. However, this is purely aesthetic and provides no tangible improvements or drawbacks beyond the inherent properties the armor already provides.  
Once summoned, the armor, in whatever form it may take, grants you the power to command and absorb energy, transforming it into a deadly weapon or an unyielding shield, depending on the situation. From your hands, you can unleash radiant waves or searing beams of pure energy, sweeping across the battlefield with devastating results, or conjure immense, shimmering domes to repel even the most brutal onslaughts. This mastery over energy affords you a graceful offense and an impenetrable defense, making you a force few can withstand.

The armor, on its own, provides with you incredible protection from threats, both physical and immaterial, while eliminating the original's susceptibility to electricity—be it from the ferocious onslaught of an Ultimate Vaxasaurian, searing blasts of pure mana, or even the effect of mind control, it stands unmoved. However, do not take this as invincibility—a sufficiently powerful attack may still overwhelm your defenses. Nevertheless, despite its might, the armor ultimately pales in comparison to the unmatched durability and offensive prowess of the blade itself.

Ascalon, the sword itself, holds all the powers and abilities of the armor, only amplified to astonishing levels. Its exceptional durability enables it to endure the cataclysmic destruction of an entire planet while its energy slashes eclipse the blasts unleashed from your armor. Yet, these abilities are merely just the beginning. Ascalon can slice through any material and even the fabric of reality, allowing you to create portals to any destination with a single, deft slash, rewrite, or reverse localized reality. When fully empowered, it can even alter or control fundamental aspects of the universe, including the annihilation of all evil.

Drach’nyen: The Echo of the First Murder (Warhammer 40K)  
Cost: 30 SP  
Drach’nyen is a powerful daemonic warp predator that has been known by many names in the history of humankind, such as The End of Empires and The Echo of the First Murder. This aetheric monster of humanity's sins now takes the form of a massive, two-handed sword, though in truth, it could take the form of any weapon its wielder desires. Born at the moment of the first murder, the first time a human killed another outside of the need to survive.

The name Drach’nyen is an approximation of the scream of the first murderer and that of the brother he murdered. That single act of evil planted a seed in the Immaterium, which would blossom into the daemon Drach’nyen, for every life taken by a human anywhere, every word of hatred spoken into the ears of the dying and dead, every thought of willingly murdering another to further one's own goals, makes this daemonic sword stronger.  
Upon its blade can be seen the faces of every murderer humanity has ever produced, bubbling to the surface with a silent scream before disappearing beneath the surface of the blade again. The sword is powerful enough to rend reality apart where it strikes, destroying anything and everything in its path without so much as any resistance.  
Drach'nyen also acts as a powerful passive psychic attack upon all one's foes in a large area around the wielder, attacking their minds with psychic torment, images, sounds, smells, pain, fear, and feelings of their own acts of murder, now turned back upon themselves. This has no effect on those who are entirely innocent of the crime of murder. Furthermore, the daemon animating the sword can greatly empower its chosen wielder with unnatural strength and fortitude. Having devoured and gorged itself on the blood of the Emperor of Mankind, its strength is far from finished developing.

Drach’nyen would normally extract a heavy toll on anyone wielding it, eating away at their sanity and morality; however, you are singularly immune to this; it’s voice has no effect on you outside of what a voice from a daemonic sword could normally convince you to do, hopefully very little, even being able to shut out its voice entirely should you choose so. It cannot communicate with or influence anyone else outside of you. Furthermore, should someone other than you try to use it, they will find the sword will fall through their hand as though it were made of air, though not before rending apart the offending limb with violent warp energy.  
*The Origin of Murder*  
Required:Original Vampire (World of Darkness \- Vampire: The Masquerade)  
Though Cain you might not precisely be. His sins you have, nevertheless, taken upon yourself. As the one responsible for the concept of murder being created Drach’nyen is especially taken with you. You have its complete and total loyalty. And furthermore your mere presence has unlocked it’s latent potential. Drach’nyen in your hands has the ability to deal death to anything as long as a single attack hits. It needs not be a sure hit, even a single nick is enough to kill. The blade merely needs to bite the least bit into something which you want dead, and it will be so.  
Furthermore the blade enhances your vampiric abilities, drinking blood for you, as every being with vitae you slay will instantly have all its sweet succulent life juices transferred to you upon their demise.

## Other Power Chars

### Physical

Jötunn  
Cost: 25 SP  
You are a Jötunn, a being descended from Ymir, the First Giant. Compared to the Gods, you are more an aspect of nature manifested—a part of the True Wild rather than civilization.  
This does not mean you are incapable of being civilized, however, as many Jötunn and Gods have intermarried throughout history.  
Jötunn are beings of immense power and magic, most often but not always distinguished by their towering size, standing several heads taller than a human, and often wielding the destructive forces of nature. For instance, you can hurl boulders weighing several hundred tons, sprint at speeds of several hundred meters per second, or recover from fatal wounds in mere days.  
They appear in many forms, from a stunning 10-meter-tall woman, a monstrous creature with ten heads, or even in the shape of animals. As a Jötunn, you can freely choose your form, as long as it exudes a supernatural aura—whether as a massive human or an animal with hair, beard, or fur made of leaves, or anything else that strikes your fancy.  
You obtain immense physical and magical might. Many Jötunn are deeply connected to the elements and the world around them, granting them exceptional affinities for specific magical arts or physical prowess that surpasses their peers.  
However, you are not restricted to your chosen affinity. Many Jötunn become master craftsmen, skilled weavers, fearsome warriors, or insightful seers capable of foreseeing the future and delivering prophecies far beyond their initial talents.  
You can also uncover the hidden paths to the mysterious realms of the Jötunn—secret ways concealed in the mountains, the twilight horizon, or even the flickering flames of a fire.  
*Dwarf*  
Required:The Craftsman  
You now also possess the powers inherited from the other children of Ymir—the Dwarves. This greatly enhances your affinity for crafting, extending it to encompass nearly all forms of creative works.  
Whether it is in blacksmithing, where you can forge weapons on par with Mjölnir or the fetters that bound Fenrir; weaving, where you can craft cloaks of invisibility that hide you from the senses of mortals; or brewing, where you can create meads capable of granting divine inspiration from blood and much more—you excel in all of these arts.  
You achieve this by using esoteric and conceptual ingredients such as the roots of a mountain, the sound of the wind, honor, or anything else your imagination can conceive.  
*Child of Loki*  
Required: Blood of the Gods, or Demigod (Percy Jackson)  
You are akin to the other children of Loki, granting you the potential for limitless growth in power, such that, over time, you can rival even the mightiest of the gods. You need only look to your siblings for inspiration.  
Fenrir, who grows endlessly and was chained by the gods out of fear; Jörmungandr, the World Serpent, whose size allows him to encircle Midgard and whose venom is capable of slaying even the strongest; or Hel, ruler of the Underworld, who holds dominion over all souls not claimed by Odin or Freya for their halls.  
This heritage accelerates your journey towards godhood, with your previously chosen abilities and affinities evolving over time. They will eventually become tied to your domain and take on a conceptual nature, further cementing your divinity.  
*Útgarða-Loki*  
Required: The Mist (Percy Jackson), or Illusion Magic  
You are now a Magician and Illusionist with the same level of skill as Útgarða-Loki. This grants you the ability to create illusions capable of even deceiving Gods and enchanting the World, giving form to the formless.  
With this power, you can ensure that whenever someone attempts to strike you, they hit nothing but the ground, oblivious to the fact that you haven’t even moved. You can shape the land to appear as a grand castle filled with actual food that can be eaten and much more.  
Your mastery of enchantment extends far beyond simple illusions. Drawing inspiration from the legendary deeds of Útgarða-Loki, you can shape wildfire into a man with an insatiable appetite, transform thought into a being with the speed of the mind, embody old age as an undefeatable old woman, link the World Serpent to a cat to make it immovable, or create an "endless" drinking horn connected to the ocean.  
Father of the World  
Cost: 30 SP  
Required:Jötunn  
You are now akin to Ymir, a primordial being born from the Gap before the World. Your power and exalted nature are such that, if you were somehow killed, your very flesh could be shaped into a new Universe, with your body serving as the foundation for a new generation of Gods and Giants.  
Yet, even while alive, you possess the ability to create and manipulate the phenomena of the World. You wield power and authority over all natural things, such as water, wind, earth, fire, metals, jewels, and trees, to name a few.  
If you so desire, you can recreate the primordial realms of Niflheim and Muspelheim, drawing upon their essence to shape new worlds or even beings equal to yourself. However, such a feat would require centuries of effort, even for one as powerful as you.  
*Texture of Scandinavia*  
Required: Divine Spirit (Type-Moon), or Incarnated God (Type-Moon)  
Your existence as a Primordial Jötunn has fused with your other half as a Divine God. This conceptual union grants you access to the Norse Texture of the World—a realm destroyed centuries ago by Surtr during Ragnarök.  
This connection allows you to gradually recreate the Texture, along with all the beings and magic it once contained, thanks to your life-giving properties. Over time, you will not only gain the Authorities of the Norse gods but also those of the Jötunn, including Surtr’s sword Laevatein and Fenrir’s Authority over Ice.  
You can choose to "deploy" and project the Texture onto the current world, replacing its existing reality with your own, thereby destroying what is presently there. Alternatively, if you wish to avoid destruction, you can take the slower path of integrating the existing world into your Texture, gradually taking control of it.  
Should you choose to deploy the Texture, the location where you do so becomes your "Throne". This Throne can take any form you desire, but if it is destroyed before the world’s destruction or integration, you will suffer immense backlash, with death being a possibility.  
With time, you may truly become Ymir reborn and reign as the Sovereign you were always destined to be.  
*Texture of Kemet*  
Required: Divine Spirit (Type-Moon), or Incarnated God (Type-Moon)  
Required:Egyptian Deity (Gods of Egypt)  
Through your divine blood and source of power, your Akh, or soul, is now intrinsically tied to Egypt—or Kemet, as it was known in antiquity. As a being capable of existing within the Darkness and the Primeval Ocean, you hold the power to Name and bring forth the Texture of Kemet from nothingness once more.  
This power enables you to slowly Name all things within the Texture, restoring them to the World. As you do so, you will gain the ability to summon and control the beings within it, such as the Sphinx, which wards off spirits; the Bennu, which carries the soul for rebirth; and Ammit, the devourer of souls, among many others.  
By Naming and recreating even the gods themselves, you become the All-Father of Kemet, inheriting their Authorities to shape the World as you see fit. You can assume their divine and animal forms, cementing your right to rule—a right that can neither be denied nor overturned, ensuring your eternal reign.  
You can choose to "deploy" and project the Texture onto the current world, replacing its existing reality with your own, thereby destroying what is presently there. Alternatively, if you wish to avoid destruction, you can take the slower path of integrating the existing world into your Texture, gradually taking control of it.  
Should you choose to deploy the Texture, the location where you do so becomes your "Throne". This Throne can take any form you desire, but if it is destroyed before the world’s destruction or integration, you will suffer immense backlash, with death being a possibility.  
*Texture of Mesopotamia*  
Required: Divine Spirit (Type-Moon), or Incarnated God (Type-Moon)  
Required:Bull of Heaven (Type-Moon)  
You now hold a Tie of En to the Texture of the Mesopotamian Gods through your ownership of the Great Bull of Heaven, Gugalanna. As the World Father, this connection grants you the power to recreate this Texture and all that exists within it.  
Over time, you may slowly summon the various divine beasts of Mesopotamia, such as Anzu, the fire- and water-breathing bird, or Mushussu, the dragon-serpent that protects cities and enables travel between realms.  
As you progress in the rebirth of the Texture, you will gradually lay claim to the Authorities of the gods and their Divine Armaments. For example, you may wield Ereshkigal's power to control the Underworld and bind even the gods who enter, or command the Axe of Marduk, a weapon that is the size of a building.  
With Gugalanna, you have a choice: you may take his power, authority, and divine bull form for yourself, or allow him to remain a separate entity in your service.  
You can choose to "deploy" and project the Texture onto the current world, replacing its existing reality with your own, thereby destroying what is presently there. Alternatively, if you wish to avoid destruction, you can take the slower path of integrating the existing world into your Texture, gradually taking control of it.  
Should you choose to deploy the Texture, the location where you do so becomes your "Throne". This Throne can take any form you desire, but if it is destroyed before the world’s destruction or integration, you will suffer immense backlash, with death being a possibility.  
*Pangu, Divider of Heaven & Earth*  
Required: Divine Spirit (Type-Moon), or Incarnated God (Type-Moon)  
Required:Philosophy Foundation (Type-Moon)  
You, who share a connection to the Tiānxià Texture, now ascend to the mantle of the Primordial Giant Pangu, a being of your same exalted nature. This bond significantly enhances your abilities and accelerates your capacity to reforge the Tiānxià Texture. As Pangu’s inheritor, you embody his divine potential, standing as a cosmic force poised to shape the world.  
However, like Pangu himself, you are bound by the necessity of growth. Though your power is heightened, it will take centuries of development before you achieve the true might required to part Heaven and Earth as Pangu once did. Until you reach this zenith, your strength remains immense yet incomplete, a promise of the unparalleled divinity that lies ahead.

Most crucially, you have inherited Pangu's Nameless Axe, the Heaven Splitting Axe that defined his legend. This mythical weapon, imbued with the essence of cosmic separation, is an equal to Ea, the Sword of Rupture of Mesopotamian myth. The axe's power is unparalleled, capable of splitting dimensions, cleaving through the fabric of reality, and bringing forth order from primordial chaos. Its existence marks you as a shaper of worlds, a being of supreme consequence in the cosmic hierarchy.  
As Pangu's mantle-bearer, you are destined to walk the path of a creator and divider, balancing growth with the weight of a giant’s responsibility. Your bond with the Tiānxià Texture and mastery of the Heaven Splitting Axe mark the first steps of your journey to rival the deeds of the Primordial Giant himself.

Bastet  
Cost: 35 SP  
Required:Cait Sidhe  
Required:Nekomata  
Your spiritual and fairy natures have come together and expanded beyond what either would ever hope to become alone. You have awakened, within you, an Eye of Ra, granting you the full creative power of the sun goddess you are destined to embody.  
Wherever you look, the sun shall shine. Whatever bathes within your sunlight will find itself restored, should you wish it. No sickness or injury, physical, spiritual, or esoteric in nature will be able to resist the restorative power of your light. With little effort, your light is capable of restoring the fertility to the lands of an entire nation and beyond. Your sight shall never be denied to you, and you can easily direct your light upon yourself, banishing the concept of injury and unwanted harm on your being.  
You can take your restorative abilities a step further and bring life into being, either within yourself or within those that receive your sunlight. Any life that is brought to bear in this way is guaranteed to be born with perfect health, devoid of any illness, genetic, random, or otherwise. Any that carry your life are guaranteed to undergo the process without issue or harm, and will experience it at an expedited rate.  
As a master of life, you are not obligated to share your grace with others, and can even rescind your gift with a mere touch. A touch is all you need to claim the life-force of anyone you please in any quantity. As an extension of your fey and spiritual abilities, you can fully manipulate the souls within others, push, pull, or twist them into whatever configuration suits your needs. The amount of ghostly fire you can conjure is now able to match the output of the sun itself. Your presence can evoke a great sense of peace and can fully soothe the wrathful. Pushing your divine presence enforces serenity upon your surroundings, negating aggressive drives in those around you.  
*Through the Eyes of the Sun*  
Required:Sekhmet  
The joining of your two halves has seen your light grow beyond bounds. You now claim the entirety of the sun’s light as your and any light on earth as your divine eyes. Every photon, from the dimmest embers of a dying flame to the lonely spark traveling the expanse of the cosmos, is an extension of yourself.  
Merging with your martial half has brought a whole host of empowerment and blessings you may confer to those that bask in your peaceful rays. A mere spark of your divine grace is enough to send any of your blessed beyond their limits. However, be careful not to overcharge your followers too much, for only the most resolute will be able to handle the full weight of your light.

Sekhmet  
Cost: 35 SP  
Required:Cheetah  
Required:Leopard  
Your mastery over your body has reached its limit and refused to stop. Igniting the power of your soul has incinerated the limits that once held you back. You have taken more than a step, or even a leap and a bound, forward into the realm of gods. As the fire within you stabilizes and fills you with its warmth, you open an Eye of Ra, granting you the vengeful power and heat of the sun befitting the warrior goddess that beckons your destiny.  
With a mere breath, you can bring forth the fiery might of the sun to bear against your enemies. The heat at your control can burn away and banish the very notion of evil, destroying its vessels and warding against its return. Should you wish it, you can bring your heat against the world itself, giving rise to massive deserts.  
Those that bask in your heat will find disease and other ailments fail to progress, allowing them to recover at expedited rates. So long as your heat remains, those in your heat will continue to enjoy an absence of disease in any form. In the unlikely event you shall find yourself defeated, you need only wait no longer than a day as you find yourself fully renewed upon the dawn of a new day. Yet, before you get to that point, you can turn your flames upon yourself and burn away the concept of your injuries to reforge yourself into peak condition.

While your power is a vengeful one, you still hold a mastery over it, and thus can freely choose how your fire and heat interact with the world around you. You can blast an entire nation into a desert of glass without touching a single hair on the head of any of its citizens. You can imbue the concept of your heat into objects and foods, giving birth to potent weapons capable of defeating evil, and creating medicines and tonics capable of burning away what ails a person. Your martial might is enough to stand against the whole of humanity and bring them to their end should another god not come to distract you.  
Taking the visage of a lion, your presence can evoke a great sense to act and work towards one’s ambitions. Pushing the weight and authority of your presence, the ferocity of your royal visage can bring the most boisterous and arrogant to heel.  
*Heralded by the Morning Star*  
Required:Bastet  
The merging of your two halves has seen a great expansion to what you claim as your purview. You are intimately aware of everything within your light and fully capable of processing that information to whatever amount you wish. You don’t need precognition because the rate at which you gather information is instantaneous, but like any other limit, that won’t stop you. The flow of information within your light flows faster for you than anyone else, granting you your own form of precognition as you learn what happens before causality makes it so. This is your Morning Star.  
As the Herald of your solar might, your Morning Star grants you free travel to anywhere within your light, at whichever speed you demand. As you grow in strength, so will your Morning Star. In time, you will be able to claim the authority of other sources of light throughout the cosmos in increasing orders of magnitude. No matter where you find yourself in the cosmos, you will always see yourself able to stand before the entirety of the dominant species that shares your home.

Blood of the Gods  
Cost: 15 SP  
Somehow, the very lifeblood of the gods: ichor flows through your veins. A spark of divinity has embedded itself within your soul, transforming your heart into a generator that steadily produces ichor and pumps it throughout your body. This gift has granted you immortality, eternal youth, and extraordinary physical abilities. You can lift semi-trucks above your head, leap onto the roofs of three-story buildings, and run at a maximum of 100 miles per hour for half a day before feeling fatigued. Your regenerative abilities are greatly enhanced; you can regrow entire limbs within minutes and even recover from losing half of your head. However, this is not absolute immortality, complete destruction of your head will still be fatal.  
On the esoteric side you become naturally resistant to curses, diseases, poisons, illnesses, and negative magical effects. Any that does take hold of you can be recovered from in a matter of hours to days depending on just how persistent and powerful they're.  
Beyond physical enhancements, the ichor is rich in mana, allowing you to use your own blood as a reservoir for casting magic. This can serve as your primary magical source if you lack one or act as a secondary pool to complement any magical reserves you possess. Additionally, your blood, if consumed by another, acts as a powerful healing elixir that grants them regenerative abilities on par with your own for a few minutes and restores their mana. It can also be stored and used as a magical reagent or in item creation to amplify an item's power, so be cautious about letting it fall into the wrong hands.  
Over time, the ichor will gradually transform your body, causing you to grow in power and, slowly but surely, evolve into an actual god. If you were already a god or divine in some other way this works as an amplifier to those power

The Composite Human  
Cost: 10 SP  
You have become the Composite Human; the hypothetical result of the amalgamation of the best aspects of every human who has ever existed or currently exists into a single individual. You possess every skill, trait, knowledge, experience and natural capability that any member of Homo sapiens sapiens has ever had without any fault or drawback.

Your physical condition and genetics are the pinnacle of humanity. You have the conditioned muscle mass of the strongest weightlifters, possess peak human senses, have enhanced durability thanks to abnormally high bone density, can run hundreds of kilometres without rest and can hold your breath for over 24 minutes, all to name but a few.

This also includes more exotic attributes such as Marfan syndrome which grants exceptionally flexible joints or congenital analgesia, enabling you to feel no pain. You may freely turn off and on particular traits and can display seemingly incompatible traits simultaneously. For example, you could concurrently have the light nimbleness needed to perform acrobatic stunts alongside the sheer muscle mass required for peak human strength.

Moreover, you can freely change your appearance, drawing upon the many features humans have had throughout history and the modern day. Do you wish to be as tall as Angus MacAskill, have the eyes of Audrey Hepburn or the beard of Frederick Douglas? It's all possible.  
However, it is your mind which is perhaps your greatest asset. Your intelligence is the best of humanity in every respect, enabling you to achieve mental feats on par with the most brilliant savants and geniuses of all time. Your charisma matches that of legendary leaders, your creativity mirrors the greatest artists and your wisdom draws from the collective insights of the most renowned philosophers.  
Furthermore, you possess every skill or expertise that any human has ever had. You know and understand all human knowledge across every possible field of study, are a master of every martial art ever created (including muscle memory), have perfect fluency in all forms of language, have intimate familiarity with every historical human event… the list goes on and on.  
You have an unlimited memory through which you can store and recall all of this information. This knowledge continuously updates as all of humanity's thoughts, actions and memories flow into you; even permitting a form of pseudo-mind reading if desired.  
Finally, while this power is based upon humanity within this universe, it will update no matter where you are, allowing you to become the composite of all humanity of the universe that you are in so long as they can be considered “human”. The more powerful the version of humanity, however, the longer it will take you to acclimatise to become a composite of them.  
*The Composite Genus*  
Required:Apex Specimen  
You are no longer limited to being merely a composite of humanity; your power now extends to similarly affect any other species or race that you exist as.  
Whether you are a vampire, orc, elf or any other being, you have become the singular fusion of your entire species. You possess all the traits, skills, knowledge, and abilities that your race has currently or has ever had in its history. If you are a hybrid of multiple races, you can become a composite of all of them respectively.  
What’s more, all of the capabilities, attributes and talents you have gained from being the composite of your race are enhanced to be significantly greater than any other member, as befitting of being the Apex Specimen. For example, if someone from your race was a once-in-a-lifetime prodigy in nature magic, your aptitude, power and potential with nature magic would substantially exceed theirs in every respect.  
*The Multiversal Composite*  
Required:Multiversal Constant  
You're no longer confined to just being the composite of humanity within your universe. Instead, your power now spans throughout your entire local multiverse cluster, making you the combined composite of every version of the Homo sapiens species from across all of these universes.  
As such, every trait, talent, knowledge and natural ability that any human has ever developed across your local multiverse, whether in the past or present, is now yours. For instance, if humans in one universe evolved to breathe underwater, you would have that ability. Likewise, you could tap into the complete scientific expertise of humanity from a highly technologically advanced universe.

Succubus/Incubus  
Cost: 12 SP  
You are a Succubus or Incubus, a demon who embodies desire, temptation, and danger, exploiting humanity's carnal desires. Your transformation enhances your body in several ways: your attractiveness is significantly increased, making you highly desirable. Additionally, your appearance will shift to match your idealized self. Your physical strength now allows you to toss humans effortlessly with one hand and move at speeds invisible to the naked eye. You also gain bat-like wings that enable flight and can retract at will. Furthermore, your lifespan extends into the thousands of years.  
Your true power, however, lies in your various minor supernatural abilities, including dream manipulation, lifeforce draining, shapeshifting, regeneration, healing, mind manipulation, mind reading, and illusions. Through dream manipulation, you can enter and alter others' dreams, interacting and draining life force without physical contact, and even trapping targets in their nightmares. Lifeforce draining ranges from leaving a person exhausted to completely withered, requiring direct contact for maximum effect. Initially, a mere kiss can exhaust someone.  
Shapeshifting allows you to adopt forms that resonate with your target’s desires, becoming more adept and diverse with experience. Regeneration depends on the lifeforce you've collected, allowing rapid healing and contributing to your longevity. Healing involves transferring some of your lifeforce to others, strengthening their regenerative abilities and potentially reviving the recently deceased.  
Mind manipulation starts with subtle influences, like amplifying emotions or directing attraction, growing to control even a powerful enemy with a look. Mind reading helps tailor your interactions by revealing desires and, eventually, deeper memories and thoughts when close by.  
For defense, you rely on illusions that initially affect only sight and sound but can evolve to involve all senses, drawing upon a target’s deepest fears.  
Despite these strengths, you have a weakness to silver, which severely harms you like acid upon contact  
Monarch of Desire  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:Love & War  
Through your veins now flows the royal blood of your kind, causing your abilities as a Succubus/Incubus to far eclipse your kin, for you have become a Succubus Queen / Incubus King.

Your ascension into royalty has resulted in your natural form once again undergoing changes. To start off with, your beauty has become so great, even inhuman beings and your own kin will find you enchanting. Now, upon your head sits a pair of horns, through which supernatural abilities can be controlled and focused, allowing one to leave their hands free. From your back emerges a second set of wings, allowing for greater speed and maneuverability in the air.

This new blood has also caused your physical abilities to exceed even those succubi/incubi that follow the path of bloodlust. Now your strength has become monstrous, able to create tremors with a palm strike or blast a hole through an oil tanker with a slap. Your speed is blazing, able to reach hypersonic speeds, allowing you to race missiles. Your durability renders you immune to all but the strongest conventional weaponry, such as railguns and bunker busters. Finally, your sheer vitality has granted you biological immortality, as you cease aging upon reaching your prime.

Your supernatural abilities have increased immensely in scale and in power.

Starting off, dream manipulation and illusions have merged, allowing you to now blur the line between dreams and reality. This could allow you to perform feats such as creating illusionary organs that function like real ones.

Next, your lifeforce draining has grown to where your mere presence could drain your targets into desiccated corpses.

Further, your shapeshifting has overcome its initial limitations, now allowing you to freely change your appearance as you like. You are even able to develop more inhuman traits such as additional limbs or merging of traits such as your tail and a mouth, making it so you can eat with your tail.

Your regeneration has become partially passive, as any non-fatal wound no longer requires lifeforce to be healed. Instead, lifeforce is used to recover from any fatal injury so long as at least a hand amount of you remains.

Your healing has evolved the capabilities of enhancement and resurrection, as you can now transfer lifeforce to strengthen and prolong the lifespan of your target. As well as resurrect any dead so long as you have a piece of their corpse and lifeforce, scaling with the amount of time they had been deceased.

Finally, your mind manipulation has expanded its range, allowing it to affect those within a few blocks of you. It can also now affect abnormal beings such as golems and machines capable of limited thinking.

Your royal blood has also granted you two new abilities; conversion and malleability. Conversion is the ability to convert others into Succubi or Incubi depending on your preference. Those born of you naturally have such loyalty that they would sooner die than even consider the possibility of betraying you. Whilst, malleability is a change to your body’s nature based upon desires rather than logic. This allows your body to stretch, contort, and move in ways that would injure or potentially kill others with no issue.  
*Guide to Desire*  
Required:Monster of Desire  
Your innate connection to desire as a Succubus Queen / Incubus King has allowed you to understand and benefit from the desires of others, especially the obsessive ones. In particular, you are able to with a glance know one’s primary desire, and grow stronger the more those either around you or manipulated by you indulge in said desires, such as pushing one who has an obsession with Justice into acting like the punisher.  
*Fiendish Royalty*  
Required:Half-Devil (DxD)  
Your nature as a Succubus Queen / Incubus King has synergized with your Devil heritage. This union has granted two new attributes to your abilities. Firstly, you now gain extra free lifeforce when you complete a contract to add on top of whatever payment had been agreed upon. Secondly, your shapeshifting has gained the ability to grant abilities with your inhuman traits akin to what is seen with Stray Devils, yet controlled.  
*Disciplined Desire*  
Required:The Chad Grindset Enjoyer  
As a Succubus Queen / Incubus King you would be expected to be driven solely by selfish whims and all-consuming desires, yet instead you have sought the path of discipline and control over yourself. This newfound discipline and control have granted you new capabilities. Firstly, you are now nigh-immune to effects that alter and control your desires and emotions. Secondly, your martial talent has flourished into great talent at all you truly focus on, showing prodigious growth so long as you maintain that focus.

Immortal Sun  
Cost: 35 SP  
You are a sun made incarnate, conveying upon you all its grand power. You possess the durability and sheer physical power of a star, and have an immense amount of energy to call upon. You can call upon any effect that a star can produce, from massive solar winds, insane levels of radiation, scorching rays of light and heat, to even monstrous levels of gravity.  
Your energy may be freely used to power your other abilities, freely able to convert to any other power source you need, and will passively enhance them regardless of conversion.  
While you may possess the power of a star in its entirety, immortal and untouchable by most, you also possess absolute and perfect control and understanding over all your powers, granting instinctive mastery and knowledge over your powers domain, keeping you from destroying everything around you without intending to. You can control your power in its every manifestation as effortlessly as breathing, capable of just as easily controlling even the most minute production of heat, unnoticeable to almost all, as you are in simply unleashing all of your power in a supernova.  
*Unconquered Sun*  
Required:Solar Exalted (Exalted)  
Your nature as an Immortal Sun and an Exalted of Sol Invictus have strengthened each other.  
You are no longer a representation of the sun that you know, but rather a hypergiant, the largest stars in the known universe.

Suffering is Strength  
Cost: 20 SP  
You know pain, you know what it is like to feel your bones break, your skin burnt, your flesh cut, your very blood flowing out of your body, and all it does is make you stronger. With any type of effect that harms you now, provided you survive it, you gain a scaling resistance that reduces that to effectively zero. Have your ribs crushed and that same blow will have no more of an effect than a stiff breeze upon your skin, have your arm burnt with and that same blaze would have the same effect as the sun on an autumn day. As a bonus you’ve gained an absurd tolerance for pain.

Apex Specimen  
Cost: 15 SP  
You are at the top of your species. Your physical and mental condition is unparalleled. Every aspect of your being is enhanced to be greater than any other member of your species.

Inherent racial weakness find no hold on you. You could walk under the glorious light of the sun if you were a vampire, and retain your mind while bathing in the beauty of a full moon as a werewolf. All racial abilities are enhanced and your potential is no longer limited.

You may even generate abilities unique to yourself through enough experience and determination. Mastering abilities associated with your species becomes significantly easier, such as shape-shifting into a wolf at any time as a werewolf or becoming proficient in blood magic as a vampire.  
*Transcendent Specimen*  
Required:The "Hercules" Method (The Strange Talent of Luther Strode)  
The "Hercules" Method which trains the user's mind, body and spirit into perfection has merged with your current existence as the pinnacle of perfection for your species, enhancing every aspect of yourself even further.

You now start out having fully mastered the Method, further improving your condition and all your innate racial abilities to such an extent that you could now almost be considered an entirely different species. If before you could fly like a bird? Now you fly at almost hypersonic speeds. Furthermore, your capacity to master abilities associated with your race has also improved to the point that you can spontaneously acquire and use these abilities with absolute mastery at will.

Through your efforts to reach perfection, you continuously develop and improve in all respects without limit at a rate similar to Dynamist Jr. This ability, however, preferentially focuses on enhancing your current capabilities instead of adding new ones.

Lazarus Syndrome  
Cost: 30 SP  
You have contracted a transdimensional bacterium called malaise, which causes a condition that has been colloquially dubbed as 'Lazarus Syndrome'. This bacterium completely rewrites their host's personal dimensional structure, rendering them completely immune to any forms of premature ceasing as to preserve the host and in turn themselves. This typically manifests as the ability to come back from the dead.

But this isn't the end of your new abilities, however. The second most prominent effect Lazarus Syndrome causes is to occasionally generate powers in relation of how you died. Death by sword? Maybe you can disconnect your body parts, or perhaps become very good a swordplay. Death by crushing? Perhaps your body will become super-dense or allow you to become intangible. You never really get to choose, but it'll always be related to how you die. The more you know how you died, or will die, the more you can narrow down what power will manifest.

### 

### Mental and Psychic

Watcher of a Thousand Eyes  
Cost: 4 SP  
Required:Mind's Eye  
Required:Spirit Sight (Mieruko-chan)  
You have gained the power to see. Any eye or perception-based powers become noticeably stronger and your vision cannot be obscured by any means \- whether through illusions or attempts to physically blind you such as curses or darkness \- as your eyes pierce through all which seeks to block your perception and allow you to gaze upon the Truth of this world.  
You have also gained the ability to project your vision outwards, conjuring innumerable phantasmal eyes through which you can see as if they were your own, matching and even surpassing your original eyes in terms of perceptive capability. These eyes count as your own eyes for the sake of any of your eye-based powers, meaning that if you have some kind of effect which only activates through line-of-sight you can activate it through your eyes. This connection for powers is one-way, as only you benefit from it.  
The eyes can fly in all directions at your running speed \- or even teleport if you possess the ability to \- and you can mentally control them, directing their movement as you see fit. There is no range limitation on how far these eyes can go from you, in fact you can sense through them across dimensional boundaries, seeing through them even if you are entire worlds away. Furthermore, the eyes are not truly present in the world and are capable of phasing through matter and most protections \- only held back by extremely powerful or specialized defenses \- and can only be perceived if you will it or if the observer possesses equal or greater perception to your own.  
As you create eyes your mind expands to accommodate them, spawning a new instance of thought for each eye you conjure, meaning you can never be overwhelmed by them. Your phantasmal eyes can be any shape or size provided they resemble an eye in some way, ranging from anatomical replicas of your own eyes to stylized eyes made of flowing lines.

Archive  
Cost: 5 SP  
For every power that you pick up now, you are granted a complete and incredibly extensive mental archive filled with information, techniques, exercises, blueprints and so on that can considerably speed up your progress with it. If you focus you can actually enter an internal world where this archive manifests in a manner of your choice, whether it be a library, a lab, or whatever else you need. If you possess a power that grants you a personal or internal world/domain of your own, your archive can also physically manifest there as well. The archive will grow the more of it you learn, seeming to never reach an end.  
*Mentor*  
Required:(Thinker) Simulacrum Advisor  
You can now summon a simulacrum of anyone that possesses knowledge of anything in the archive. If there is no one that you are aware of, or simply do not have one that you like, you can instead have the archive construct a perfect teacher for you, and can freely swap teachers at any time.  
*Library of Alexandria*  
Required:(Thinker) Omniscient  
Instead of simply receiving an archive for your power, you receive an archive of everything. This includes information from other universes and anything else you can think of. This doesn’t give you the power, skill, or know-how of any other power, but it does contain the knowledge for you to peruse inside it.

Lie Eater  
Cost: 10 SP  
As the possessor of the Lie Eater ability, you gain an uncanny intuition, allowing you to discern with unerring precision when a person is telling a lie and precisely what the falsehood entails. This innate lie-detection ability becomes an indispensable tool in any social interaction or conflict.

However, the true strength of the Lie Eater lies in its unique capability to weave its own fabrications that are nearly indistinguishable from reality. When you tell a lie, it becomes exceptionally persuasive, causing even the most skeptical minds to believe the falsehood. This makes you a master manipulator, adept at steering conversations, situations, and even outcomes in your favour.

Furthermore, the power of Lie Eater extends beyond mere words, enabling you to create tactile illusions. When you lie, your words can manifest as convincing illusions, fooling the senses of those who hear the falsehood. These tactile illusions can be employed to create deceptive mirages, simulate sensations, or even conjure lifelike apparitions, making it a potent weapon for both offense and defense.

Telepathy  
Cost: 5 SP  
Anyone that you've seen in person is added to a list of contacts, of which you can communicate with mentally. Only you can start a conversation, but once started they can reply back. This communication isn't just limited to words, allowing you to send images, emotions, or even memories. While you can force a telepathic connection, they are allowed to project harmful thoughts or emotions, such as pain. This has multiversal distance.

Dream Control  
Cost: 10 SP  
You gain the ability to shape complex dreams and then force them upon others with a touch. The dream will begin the next time they fall asleep, and no matter how long you have decided the dream to last, it will be finished by the time that the person wakes up. The dreams will be completely lucid experiences.  
Black Mercy (DC Comics)  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:Dream Control  
The shaping of dreams has evolved further to emulate the alien plant the Black Mercy. This evolution has turned your dreams from mere fantasies you can inflict into entire realities.

The primary feature of the Black Mercy is that by probing the pleasure centers of the target’s mind, a nearly perfect world is created for the victim while their psychic energy is harvested and pulled back to you. During this the victim is entirely paralyzed while they’re transported into the reality, and can only escape after noting small inconsistencies and actively willing themselves awake.

The true power of the Black Mercy however, is that these are not illusions, not Dreams, but full realities that are created and projected from the victim’s desires. Every wife, child, street cleaner, cat or tree, all created and real as the ‘waking’ world. By waking up they ultimately doom this reality to nothingness.  
*Red Mercy*  
Required:What Do You Fear? (Chainsaw Man)  
Now, in addition to realities formed from the target’s deepest desires, you can instead form them from their deepest fears. These nightmare realities are equally as real as the Black Mercy’s paradises.

Unseen Hands  
Cost: 30 SP  
You now possess the ability to summon numerous invisible hand-like appendages from your body. These appendages can be telekinetically moved in any direction you want, bending, and twisting, and turning up to a range of 1 kilometer.

Only you, the user, can see and sense these hands, which act as extensions of yourself, with precise innate control and dexterity over each one as if they were your original arms. You also have unlimited multitasking capabilities.

A single hand is strong enough to effortlessly tear apart limbs, bend and break bones, reduce rocks to dust, lift heavy duty trucks and launch them dozens of meters in the air, etc. To further enhance their strength, you can combine multiple hands to create larger and more powerful variants. Each combined hand doubles their overall strength, enabling you to reach a level where lifting entire islands and crushing them to dust becomes a distinct possibility. Due to their weightless nature, each hand can achieve extreme hypersonic speeds without sacrificing any of its maneuverability in the process.

The unseen hands are completely impervious to almost all forms of harmful attacks, and are able to block and negate them all, from physical attacks, to energy attacks, to magical attacks, and even attacks of esoteric nature, etc. Their only weakness is susceptibility to damage from psychic attacks, if they do manage to land. If a hand is damaged, you can retract it into your body for a maximum of 24 hours, depending on the incurred damage, to allow for complete healing.

You have the capability to summon up to a thousand hands simultaneously. With enough practice, at their maximum potential, the Unseen Hands and the force behind each one will be capable of shredding through the strongest metal alloys as if they were a piece of paper.

If you wish, the unseen hands can be retracted completely into your body at any moment, and in case of danger that would cause you bodily harm of which you are not aware, the hands will instantly and automatically react to protect you.  
*Untouched Sights*  
Required:108 Skills  
Hands are for using skills, and skills are best used with hands. Your maximum number of hands goes from a thousand to 1080, and your hands now possess all of your 108 Skills.

*Unseen Hands Of Oblivion.*  
Required: Ten Thousand Hands of Avalokiteshvara, or Virulent Hands  
Rejoice, for the essence of death now resides in the palm of your hands, all ten thousand of them.  
Your Unseen Hands, with their ability to inflict diseases and siphoning the life force of all living things, have undergone a profound metamorphosis, evolving into the very manifestation of decay and impermanence—a force that withers all. In addition to their pure destructive power, each hand can now induce rapid decay and withering upon physical contact with either organic or inorganic matter. The target begins disintegrating swiftly from the point of contact until not a single atom of their being remains in existence, if they remain in physical contact with your unseen hand. The base strength, and speed of each hand have also increased fourfold, and their sole vulnerability to psychic attacks has been completely nullified.  
As the user, you are totally immune towards this withering ability, and you can selectively choose at will whether your hands activate this ability or not.

*Sekhmet*  
Required:Witch of Sin (Re:Zero)  
Your Witch Factor of Sloth has resonated with the similar powers of your Unseen Hands have drastically empowered them to eclipse Sekhmet, the Witch of Sloth and second most powerful Witch to exist.

You have five thousand of them and each and every one has doubled in strength and can reach up to 1000 kilometers. Additionally, your miasma flows through each of your hands, allowing you to sense the world through each one. This enables you to manipulate them accurately without needing to physically see what they’re interacting with.

If you have Ten Thousand Hands of Avalokiteshvara you will have twenty thousand hands with a range of two thousand kilometers each.  
Thousand Hands of Avalokiteshvara  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:Unseen Hands  
You now possess the ability to extend an astonishing ten thousand unseen hands simultaneously from your body, with an expanded range of up to 100 kilometers.  
These hands are now intricately connected to the life force of all things, so in addition to their inherent destructive power, each hand possesses the ability to siphon the life force when in physical contact with a living being, and then transfer that life force to the user to either heal them or to enhance the overall strength of the hands, as per the user's intention. The targeted individual experiences extreme weakening as their life force is drained, as they shrivel and wither rapidly leading to their expiration. The more the target is exposed to additional hands, the quicker the siphoning process, hastening their demise. Your unseen hands has also gained a high resistance towards psychic attacks of all forms.  
You can choose at will whether the unseen hands engage in siphoning the life force of others.

Virulent Hands  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Unseen Hands  
A malevolent curse has tainted your Unseen Hands, transforming them into instruments of potent poison and malignant diseases.  
Now, in addition to their inherent destructive power, each hand possesses the ability to infect a target with a myriad of rapidly acting diseases upon physical contact. Similar to venom injected through the poisonous fangs of a viper, these diseases will induce severe vertigo, convulsions, muscle paralysis, searing pain, internal haemorrhages, and organ failure within minutes of contact. If left untreated, the target is almost certain to expire within hours. The more the target is exposed to additional hands, the higher the dosage in their system, hastening their demise.  
As the user, you are completely immune to the diseases carried by these hands, and you can choose at will whether the hands inject the diseases when in contact with others.

The Hand Behind The Curtain  
Cost: 15 SP  
In a world entrenched in deception and power struggles, you possess supernatural skills and unparalleled expertise in planning, orchestrating, and manipulating others, allowing you to navigate the intricate web of influence with unrivaled finesse.  
As the Hand Behind The Curtain, you possess an innate understanding of the motives and intentions that drive people's actions. This insight empowers you to craft intricate, long-term strategies and campaigns that span vast domains, seamlessly accounting for all relevant factors, treasures, resources, and variables involved, orchestrating plans that could span millennia, all while ensuring that your true intentions remain hidden from prying eyes.

With your masterful manipulation skills, you become the unseen puppeteer, orchestrating events and pulling the strings from behind the scenes. Your grand designs encompass vast networks, enabling you to wield unparalleled control and shape the outcomes of pivotal moments. While others remain oblivious to your influence, you steer the development of civilizations and hold the keys to their destiny.

Additionally, your mastery extends to the art of acting, allowing you to assume different personas effortlessly. With this added ability, you can seamlessly blend into any role, concealing your true intentions as you manipulate those around you.

Wifi  
Cost: 4 SP  
Your brain is now fully connected to a high speed wifi that you can toggle on/off, enabling you to browse the internet and the infinite amount of data it contains as much as you like.  
Social media, Google, YouTube,,,etc you will be able to access everything in the online cyber space in your mind, and this connection can never be broken even if you are in different universes or dimensions.  
Since this connection to the internet is an arbitrary link in your mind, it can never be traced, hacked, or tampered with in any detrimental way.

Holmes  
Cost: 5 SP  
This power makes you a genius of deduction and perception. It doesn't make you any better at guessing, and you need sufficient evidence to make a conclusion. However, it is a lot less likely to be wrong than Tattletale's power.  
Sherlock Scan  
Cost: 8 SP  
Required:Holmes  
Your ability to plan and make predictive deductions is truly staggering. Whether in a bout of fisticuffs or at the chessboard, you are dozens of steps ahead of your opponents. Able to visualize entire engagements from beginning to end before the first blow is ever struck. This power includes minor supporting improvements to general intelligence, mental processing speed, multitasking ability, and senses.  
Moriarty  
Cost: 7 SP  
Required:Holmes  
You're now the equal and antithesis of Sherlock Holmes; while he is the world's greatest detective, you are the 'Napoleon of Crime'.  
You're still a genius of deduction and perception but your skills, abilities and knowledge have expanded to make you nearly unparalleled with regards to criminality and its planning in all its forms. You possess near-superhuman expertise and knowledge in every field of crime including forgery, blackmail, drug trafficking and more. You also have a powerful intuition regarding how best to apply your criminal expertise and knowledge to nearly any challenge you come up against.  
Your genius also encompasses Moriarty's greatest accomplishment, his global criminal network. You have an inhuman talent for setting up and controlling widespread, self-sustaining, successful criminal organisations with regard to any type of illicit activity. You can orchestrate and administrate these organisations in such a manner as to ensure their continuous secrecy and success.  
You could potentially build a world-spanning criminal underground in a matter of years, force entire governments to bend to your whims and have lifelong criminals too terrified of you to even say your name.  
The World's Greatest (Death Note)  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Sherlock Scan  
Required:Moriarty  
You have become the greatest in the criminal and legal worlds via the combined intellectual prowess of the greatest detective, L, and Light Yagami, the God of the new world.  
From L, you have gained deductive skills beyond human reason. You have a perfect memory, can instantly spot verbal and logical contradictions, find clues from minute details or actions, and have the ability to develop insidious verbal or physical traps that your opponents walk right into. However, your scariest power is your ability to psychoanalyze others. You can create a psychological profile and deduce crucial details of a target simply by knowing basic info about their actions, like time or location. You can narrow down suspects ridiculously quickly and find if they match your profile with a glance for most and a short conversation for the utmost perplexing cases.  
From Kira, you have gained a raw intellect, easily surpassing the entire world. Even without experience or resources, you can throw together complex world-altering plots. Your observational capacity can piece together the minute actions of others into their deepest secrets, goals, or short-term plans. You can then devise counterplans immediately after. You also have a penchant for manipulating others, using various pressures to make them dance to your tune. Finally, you have gained a natural charisma with your words and actions that causes others to pay attention to you, whether to follow or fear you.  
Your thinking speed, creativity, parallel processing, and learning have increased by a massive degree. You can solve unreasonably complex problems in minutes, master fields in hours, and establish secret societies in days. Depending on your personality, this level of intellectual superiority can lead to nihilistic viewpoints if you're unable to express it properly, like against a true rival.  
Elementary, My Dear (Type-Moon)  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:Sherlock Scan  
Required: Tattletale, or Sarah Livsey/Lisa Wilbourn  
Elementary, My Dear: It's Quite Simple, My Friend is the Noble Phantasm acquired by Sherlock Holmes when materialized as a Servant. It is his Origin of "Elucidation" sublimated as a Noble Phantasm.

Even if the enigma that is being opposed is truly an unresolvable mystery, the route and the clues that will finally arrive at the truth of it will "appear" without exception. For example, even if the key to a treasure chest is lost, the key will end up "not being lost", and it appears that it can be definitely discovered somewhere in the world. (However, as one would expect, it does not suddenly appear in the middle of one's hand, and wherever it is, you and your collaborators must discover it)

### Mystic and Magic

The Dedicated Healer  
Cost: 15 SP  
You are the healer—the White Mage of a hero's party, the priest(ess) of some fantasy religion, or another support character who specializes exclusively in healing and supportive magic. By default, you are at your strongest when healing a specific individual within a foot of you. However, your effective range extends up to 100 meters in all directions, with the strength of your healing and supportive spells increasing in intensity as the target gets closer to you.  
Your repertoire includes spells to mend lacerations, restore lost body parts (even without the original part), repair soul damage, cure ailments and negative effects, undo transmogrification, and even resurrect the recently deceased. The speed of these spells varies: at your maximum range, they may take hours to complete, while for someone nearby, they can work in mere seconds.  
Beyond healing, you also have supportive spells. You can temporarily accelerate a target's speed by manipulating time, create shields that halve all physical or magical damage, cast wards to render them immune to specific elements temporarily, and imbue them with enhanced strength or other buffs.  
While this makes you the ultimate healer and support member for any aspiring hero, your powers are more of an affinity than a magic system. If you were to obtain a magical system or simply possess a pool of magical energy, your abilities and potential range would be significantly amplified. For instance, your resurrection spells would no longer be constrained by how long someone has been deceased. Furthermore, you would enhance any healing or support spells from other systems beyond their normal limits or create new ones, provided they focus on healing and buffing rather than combat or debilitation.  
A side effect of this affinity is that you're one of if not the best users for holy items, divine blessings and are generally well liked by holy or divine beings.

Samusara (Soulfire)  
Cost: 50 SP  
You are the latest reincarnation of the Samusara, the eternal Font and Source of Magic. Your existence is not merely an event but a transformative phenomenon.  
Your presence causes the very fabric of the world to awaken, generating spiritual energy that spreads throughout creation, allowing magic to take root once more. This spiritual energy fuels not only your abilities but also serves as the foundation for a new magical age.  
As the flow of magic suffuses the world, it triggers profound changes. Magical plants will sprout in forgotten corners of the land, animals imbued with mystical traits will emerge, enchanted objects of incredible power will surface, and specific regions will become magical nexuses.  
Even people will begin to awaken to their latent potential, gaining innate magical abilities or being born as natural spellcasters. Civilization itself will change, shaped by this resurgence of mystical energy.

You are the Source of these transformations, the beating heart of a magical revolution. This role endows you with unparalleled potential. Your capacity for all forms of magic is boundless, transcending the limits imposed on ordinary mortals.  
Though your magical reservoir may begin modestly, it grows rapidly, expanding with each use and mastery of your powers. Flight is an innate ability that comes instinctively to you, as natural as breathing.

As the Samusara, your magic knows no boundaries. Decades of training and experience will elevate you to unimaginable heights, where there is almost nothing you cannot achieve.  
Your abilities will include, but are not limited to: time travel, rewriting destinies, or peering into alternate timelines, opening portals between realms, connecting disparate worlds, or creating entire alternate dimensions, bringing forth creatures such as dragons, phoenixes, forging enchanted artifacts, birthing magical species, or shaping new magical ecosystems, granting great power to others, creating new schools of magic, or awakening dormant magical abilities in those around you.

Your power grows exponentially, with no true ceiling. The only limit to your potential is your own imagination and the wisdom with which you wield your gifts. For those that wield your power and the magic you bring forth, you can choose to either remove their access to it or otherwise take control of them if they do not remove it themself.

However, your connection to magic comes with a profound consequence. Should you die, the flow of magic across the world will begin to fade. Over time, magical plants will wither, enchanted creatures will vanish, and mystical energy will retreat into dormancy. Yet this is not the end.  
You are bound to the eternal cycle of Samsara. In time, you will be reborn, stripped of your memories but destined to rekindle the spark of magic once again. As you grow, your powers will return, and with them, your memories of past incarnations will awaken.  
The cycle ensures that magic will never truly vanish, as long as you continue to exist.  
*Fountain of Mystery*  
Required: Magecraft (Type-Moon), Old Magic (Type-Moon), or True Magic (Type-Moon)  
One of the greatest limitations of Magecraft, Old Magic and Mystery has always been their fleeting nature. As knowledge of these arts spreads and their practices become widespread, their potency diminishes.  
This weakening, a consequence of the collective understanding of magic stripping away its enigmatic power, has historically constrained even the most gifted practitioners. But now, through your ascension, that limitation is abolished.

You have become the Endless and Limitless Font of Magic, a wellspring of eternal power. No matter how many people uncover the secrets of Magecraft, Old Magic, or True Magic—no matter how many practice and utilize its intricacies—its strength will remain undiminished.  
Magic will no longer wane with understanding. Instead, the magic you embody is self-sustaining, thriving in perpetuity regardless of how broadly it is shared or how deeply it is studied.

As the source of this resurgence, you are intrinsically connected to all Thaumaturgical Foundations in existence. This connection grants you unparalleled knowledge of their inner workings, including every spell, rite, and secret they contain.

Even the closely guarded Magecrests—magical lineages passed through generations of mage families—are fully accessible to you. With but a thought, you can unlock the deepest mysteries hidden within these crests, no matter how long they have been guarded or forgotten.  
In worlds where Magecraft or Ley Lines are absent, your presence awakens latent magical energies, allowing you to create Thaumaturgical Foundations and Magecrests from nothing.  
The ley lines of the world stir under your influence, and new magical traditions take root. You become the architect of an entirely new magical ecosystem, giving rise to families, foundations, and the flow of magic where once there was none.

Your bond with Magecrests and their bearers grants you a unique form of immortality. These Magecrests now serve as second souls, tied to your essence. Upon your death, you gain the ability to be reborn through the Head of the Family that holds the Crest. By assuming their body, you prevent the extinction of magic and maintain the continuity of your presence in the world.  
This safeguard ensures that you are not forced back into the Cycle of Reincarnation until the very last Magecrest holder has perished. Only when all Magecrests are extinguished, and magic itself is in decline, will you return to the Samsara cycle to begin anew. Until then, your essence remains intertwined with the fabric of magical existence, guarding its survival and evolution.  
You are the Fountain of Mystery, a force that ensures magic’s endurance across the ages. No longer will the spread of knowledge dilute its potency. No longer will the loss of a single mage family spell the end of centuries-old traditions. Through you, magic flourishes eternally, unburdened by the limitations of secrecy or scarcity.

As the endless source of magic, you are not merely a practitioner or a guardian of Mystery—you are its heart and soul. With you, the boundaries of what is possible continue to expand, and the magic of the world becomes boundless.  
*Font of Life*  
Required:Nature Magic (Warcraft)  
As the Samusara, you were originally the Font of Magic and Spiritual Energy, with your influence on life energy being an indirect consequence of your power. Spiritual Energy, by its very nature, enhances all things, but now your mastery has evolved.  
Your connection to Life Energy has deepened, making it a direct and transformative force under your command.

You are no longer just a conduit of magic—you are now the Font of Life Energy, the wellspring from which vitality itself flows. Your presence alone becomes a catalyst for creation and growth. Wherever you go, the world around you flourishes in extraordinary ways,  
Flowers bloom to colossal proportions, becoming as large as houses. Trees grow into towering giants, their canopies touching the heavens like living mountains. Even the earth itself can respond to your will, transforming into a massive, living entity under your guidance. Entire ecosystems thrive and expand, reshaping the natural world into a paradise of vitality.  
You wield absolute authority over life energy, granting you the ability to: cure diseases, mend wounds, and restore vitality to living beings. Even terminal illnesses and genetic defects are no challenge to your power. Just as easily, you can unleash devastating plagues and biological calamities, spreading destruction wherever you choose.  
Your mastery over life energy extends to the very fabric of existence: shape entirely new lifeforms, from simple plants to complex, sentient species. These beings are not temporary constructs but fully independent creatures, capable of sustaining themselves without your intervention.  
Transform your own body into any form of life you desire, from the smallest insect to the mightiest beast. You can also adapt features from multiple species, blending their strengths into an unparalleled form.

Beyond creating individual lifeforms, you can fundamentally alter entire species, modifying their biology, behavior, and traits to suit your vision. These changes are permanent and self-sustaining, persisting even if your magic fades.

One of the most profound aspects of this power is its permanence. Changes made through Life Energy are not tied to your existence as the Samusara. Even if you die and magic disappears from the world, the lifeforms, ecosystems, and species you have shaped will endure. They are not dependent on your power to sustain them; they become independent entities, thriving as natural parts of the world.  
Your influence as the Font of Life ensures that your legacy will outlast your lifetime. The trees you grow, the species you create, and the cures you develop will remain, reshaping the course of life itself for generations to come.

As the Font of Life, you now embody the essence of vitality and creation. You are a force of nature, capable of transforming the mundane into the extraordinary. You heal, nurture, and build—but you can also destroy, corrupt, and reshape.

Your power over life energy is not only vast but also versatile, enabling you to act as a guardian, a creator, or even a harbinger of devastation, depending on your will.  
Through you, the boundaries of life are no longer fixed. They are as limitless as your imagination, eternally expanding and evolving.  
*Gift of Talent*  
Required: Anodite (Ben 10), Great Spirit (Re:Zero), or Fairy of Paradise (Type-Moon)  
Your connection to the boundless magic of the Samusara has deepened, granting you the ability to bestow unparalleled gifts of talent and transformation upon others. What was once a limited ability to enhance others has now grown into something far more profound and versatile.  
You can now share your knowledge of specific magical methods or the traits of magical races you are familiar with, gifting these abilities to others.  
Through your influence, you can: unlock latent potential within individuals, increasing their magical aptitude and talent far beyond their natural capabilities. Even those with no inherent magical inclination can become prodigies under your guidance.  
Or you can change the very essence of an individual, turning them into a more magical race. These transformations are not limited to simple physical changes; they bestow the abilities, traits, and magical potential associated with the new species. Whether it is the energy-wielding prowess of an Anodite, the ethereal grace of a Fairy of Paradise, or another form of magical excellence, the choice is yours.  
Your gifts, while extraordinary, are not without conditions. When you grant someone greater talent or transform them into a magical being, you have the option to impose Limits or Taxes on their continued existence.  
These conditions can take many forms, depending on your desires or the nature of the pact between you and the recipient: you may take years of life from them as payment, tying the gift of their new power to their lifespan, A binding magical contract can ensure their loyalty to you, making them your ally, servant, or agent, may extract a price in exchange for their transformation—whether it be material wealth, services rendered, or a promise to fulfill a future request.

Or you can create unique and creative conditions for their gift, such as requiring regular tribute, performing a specific task, or surrendering something of value (material or abstract). This feature ensures that while you elevate others, the balance of power remains in your hands.  
You are no longer simply a benefactor but a Creator of Magical Evolution. You shape the destiny of individuals, fostering the rise of new magical beings and empowering those who may otherwise have remained ordinary. Your gifts can uplift, inspire, and transform entire societies, creating a ripple effect of magical growth.  
However, the conditions you impose ensure that your power is not misused, and that the magic you share comes with a measure of accountability and control. You decide who is worthy of these gifts and at what cost.  
You are not only the Source of Magic but also its Sculptor, crafting a world where magic thrives under your guidance and vision.

Eldritch Magic  
Cost: 8 SP  
You unlock magic made to transcend the boundaries of your reality and draw upon unfathomable, otherworldly powers. With this magic, you can unleash devastating blasts of incomprehensible energy, summon horrifying Eldritch Beasts, and manipulate the fabric of existence in ways that defy human understanding. The extent of these abilities is limited only by your skill and the resilience of your own mind.  
One of the most fearsome aspects of this magic is the ability to create intricate rituals to call upon the Outer Gods themselves. By forging a pact with one of these beings, you may gain its favor and power, effectively making it your patron. However, such rituals are extremely risky. The presence of an Outer God is a catastrophic force in and of itself, and without proper safeguards, you risk annihilation—body, mind, and soul—or worse, becoming a vessel for its inscrutable will.  
The further you immerse yourself in these magics, the more perilous it becomes. The very act of wielding such powers strains the mind and body, and the knowledge itself grows increasingly dangerous as it advances. At higher levels, these eldritch revelations can become memetic in nature, spreading like a virus to others and corrupting them with the same mind-breaking truths. Those who tread this path must do so with caution, for the line between wielding power and succumbing to madness is perilously thin.  
*Alien Influence*  
Required:Occult  
Your mastery of the Occult, combined with the raw power of Eldritch magic, has created a dangerous force. Occult practices like divination, necromancy, and curses are now infused with the alien energy of the Eldritch, elevating them to new and unpredictable heights. Divination unveils not just hidden truths but glimpses of infinite realities, while curses spread madness and corruption like a contagion. Even your tools and rituals have changed, becoming semi-sentient and alive with Eldritch energy, eager to bend reality at your command.  
The fusion of these arts allows you to summon and bind terrifying Eldritch entities through your rituals, weaving together Occult precision and otherworldly chaos. The herbs, sigils, and artifacts you grow and nurture will bear traces of alien influence, granting powers that defy natural law while introducing creeping corruption. Rituals can now reshape landscapes, alter time, or even open rifts to other dimensions, but their success is never guaranteed. The volatile combination of these forces means every act of magic risks catastrophic consequences, from uncontrolled dimensional tears to the wrath of incomprehensible beings.

Mystical Interpretation  
Cost: 10 SP  
You are now able to use stranger, alternative interpretations of magic you own.  
For example: You can now use creation magic to create antimatter, or strange quarks, or even matter with only up or down quarks, breaking the laws of physics. If you’re a necromancer, you can see spirits and souls of every living being, not just humans, including the Neanderthals, dinosaurs and giant insects, or even that of viruses, fungi, plants and bacteria.  
When you create artifacts, instead of a fire spellsword, you can create a sword that spells out the word fire, instead of a cloak of invisibility, you can create an invisible cloak, the interpretation of puns and homonyms.  
You could also crush an air conditioner as an ingredient for potions for the symbolic meaning of circulation of air to cure fevers, or you could also crush a fridge into powder as material for a potion for the same effect. You are also able to use the internet as a transmission point for diseases, and you are able to treat death as sickness to create a cure to death itself. Modern and abstract symbolisms are still symbolism.  
For elemental attributes, you could interpret the western fire, water, air and earth in a more eastern expression, in that of; fire, water, wood, metal, earth. As for how they correspond? It's your interpretation.  
You could make somebody fall into an illusion in a dream, even if that wasn’t their physical form; since they can still talk, act and hit in the same way, then of course it’s plausible that this is the real world, causing somebody to fall into a dream in a dream.  
The laws of magic and its interactions now bend to your interpretations of it.  
*What Do You Mean Magic?*  
Required:(Trump) Completely Mundane  
Your ability to use alternative interpretations of magic and your ability to treat the world as if it were normal synergize, allowing you to treat magic as if it were mundane, and the mundane as if it included magic.  
You can now see and interact with the world around you as if only the interpretations of magic you believe in were in effect, and any magic that doesn't follow your interpretation does not exist to you, and therefore cannot affect you.  
*Interpretation begets Expression*  
Required:Newton's Third Law  
Your ability to use alternative interpretations of magic and your ability to possess alternative and opposite expressions synergize, giving you the ability to transform any magic you own to fit any scenario or situation. If you're unable to find a solution using your magic normally, then use its opposite, if that doesn't work, you can interpret it differently. If that still doesn't work, you can use the opposite of your interpretation, or an interpretation of the magic's opposite expression.  
For example; you can use fire magic, interpreting it as heat magic as fire is just an exothermic reaction that releases energy in the form of heat, then you can use the opposite expression of heat magic, and as heat is just average kinetic energy, and the opposite of that is average potential energy, so now you can use your interpretive expression of fire magic to manipulate gravity.  
*This is Very Scientific*  
Required:Mystery Slayer (Type-Moon)  
Your ability to use alternative expressions of magic and your ability to enforce the physical laws synergize. Now similarly, yet differently with magic, you are able to interpret science. Now, science can truly explain everything, any miracle that happens to you, any phenomena you come across can be explained through science, and as such, be completely reproducible. Of course, some phenomena are harder to understand than most, but now, everything is explainable using science. Such things as "magic" and "mysteries" don't exist, it's all just science, and everything is explainable using the physical laws.

Golemancy  
Cost: 15 SP  
This is the art of infusing inanimate objects with a semblance of life and magic.  
There are various applications to this like making disposable minions capable of simple tasks out of all sorts of materials like dirt, fire, water, air. But you’ll also be able to create what can be described as truly intelligent AI whose programming is made of magic at higher levels.  
The bodies of your golems do not need to be mechanically flexible or capable in order to function, a pure metal statue for example would flex and move like flesh under the direction of your golem magic. This is important because this power comes with no mechanical or engineering knowledge. Though if you do have any abilities that grant you such technological knowledge you’ll find that if your golems that don’t need to use magic moving their bodies they’ll be able to use that extra magic for other things like powering enchantments built into their body or spellcasting.

This power comes paired with a minor regenerating reserve of magic, along with some minor talent for spell crafting and enchanting in general intended to help you advance the capabilities of your golems.  
This talent for spell crafting is genuinely minor meaning you’ll struggle to figure out how to cast a single standard fireball but can easily rapidly build over a dozen average golems which you’ll be able to sustain with your reserve of magical energy.

Your ability to enchant your golems is also quite exceptional even just starting out you’ll be able to give your average golem up to three enchantments that give abilities equivalent to 5 SP powers. Though either you or the golem in question will have to power those enchantments one way or another.  
Intelligent golems you make are able to cast spells that you either pre-programmed them to know or they learned after creation.  
Two qualities determine the strength of a golem and how much magic it can hold. One is the material it’s body is made of; dirt for example will barely be able to handle 1 or 2 SP enchantments meanwhile pure gold makes an excellent golem body able to handle multiple high level enchantments. The second factor is the quality and efficiency of the magical programming of the golem in question.  
If a golem’s programming is awful it won’t matter if it’s body is made out of the best material possible it will be entirely dependent on you for direction being only capable of simple tasks but as you advance your craft you’ll be able to make increasingly complex and independent golems who are even able to generate their one magical energy and think for themselves even if they’re made of dirt. Sufficiently advanced magic programming is also able to slowly start surpassing the limitations imposed by a golem’s material quality, though it’ll be months or even years of effort before you’ll be able to start giving a dirt golem enchantments comparable to higher quality materials.  
Those qualities are only considering your starting capabilities with this magic. You are able to modify the magic programming and body of a golem after its creation.  
There are ways around having to personally supply basic golem’s with energy at every moment, for example you can make them with a magic battery as part of their enchantments. You can also make stations dedicated to passively gathering or generating magical energy that golem’s with magic batteries can be programmed to go to recharge when low on power.

Heart of Runes  
Cost: 25 SP  
You have ignited your Heart of Power, a part physical, part spiritual space that overlaps your heart and soul at the same time. The Heart of Power houses your Core Runes inside of it, your Heart of Power naturally fuels and empowers your body as well, increasing your physical, mental, and spiritual condition at all times. There are three aspects to your Heart of Power's growth, it's Quantity – the maximum quantity of energy you are able to store in your Heart of Power at a time. A higher cap means that you are able to fuel more runes. quality, and rate of recharge. It's Quality – the quality of the energy you are able to store in your Heart of Power. A higher quality of energy means that each Rune is better in every way than a Rune fueled by a lower quality of energy. And it's Rate – the speed it takes for your Heart of Power to go from empty to full.

You are able to receive Wisps of power through a conceptual measure of success when confronted with adversity. The quality of the Wisps received depends entirely on the challenge, facing off against a man with only a knife would grant a lesser quality Wisp in comparison to man wearing a full set of magical armor. Wisps can be used to increase either the Quantity or Quality of your Heart of Power. Alternatively, you are able to improve your Heart of Power’s Quantity, Quality, and Rate through meditation, initially you are only able to improve one of the three at a time. With enough practice you could begin to improve two aspects at a time. Only a true master would be able to improve all three aspects of their Heart of Power at the same time. To ignite your Heart of Power is to bare your being to the world and lay claim to your first Core Rune. Core Runes are concepts, principles, and fundamental truths; these are the runes that are imprinted onto your Heart of Power. Core Runes are what every Runic Chain is built off of. You are able to make minute modifications you make to the Core Runes so they fit your Intent best.

Rune Chains are the spells of this system. These Runes Chains are unique in that they are results of practice and dedication to a combination of runes. Once you have cast a proper combination of runes enough, it can become a singular Rune Chain of its own, separate from the Core Runes that make it up yet also still connected to the growth of the individual runes. You are able to improve both the Rune Chain and the individual Core Runes at the same time.

In order to create more Core Runes, you need to design their image and your understanding of the concept in your Heart of Power. Each design is going to be connected to the meaning of each Core Rune, and you only need to make a Core Rune once for it to be permanent.

Casting using your runes is an incredibly intuitive process. You will be able to project your Core Runes directly onto the world from the start, removing any need to draw them out in the air. As your comprehension of a Rune grows, its design will become increasingly more complicated to represent that amount of understanding that goes into projecting such a vast understanding onto the world.

As you use your Runes, you will find that they grow more detailed and extravagant. This natural growth is sufficient enough for most Runic Mages, however any mage that hopes to be somebody will have to prune the inefficient parts of their Runes. This pruning process isn’t simply about cutting apart parts of your Runes and is instead focused on condensing your comprehension of a rune, finding places of overlap in your knowledge, this reduces the complexity of a rune’s design, allowing you to cast incredibly complex runes at a much faster rate.

Prestiging a Rune is done with more than your comprehension, requiring an incredible feat that has deep personal meaning to you. You are able to begin extracting your Prestige Rune(s) from your Heart of Power. Extracting a Rune crystallizes your comprehension of it, allowing you to express the same power and understanding in a less complex manner. Each time your prestige a rune, it will be pulled further from your Heart of Power and be moved closer to Reality, resting over your heart once you prestige a rune ten times.

Every time you prestige a rune, you are able to select one of three Major Boosts, Quantity, Quality, or Rate. These boosts are qualitatively different from the ones you receive from Wisps of Power. You get to pick another prestige bonus every time you prestige a rune. On the first, third, fifth, seven, and ninth prestiges you will find that you receive a Talent that is well aligned with both the Rune itself and how you use it. The closer a rune is to Reality, the faster you are able to cast it, the less energy it takes to fuel, and the faster it grows. Upon the tenth prestige, you will find that your Prestige Rune no longer needs to be projected from your Heart of Power, requiring no more energy when casting or crafting, as it is in a constant state of existence. Additionally, you receive a Capstone Talent that both grants you a passive ability related to the Rune, and strengthens the Talents earned from earlier prestiges. You are also able to prestige Rune Chains, although this only prestiges the whole Rune Chain and not the individual runes that make it up. If a Rune Chain is composed of one or more Prestige Runes, the effectiveness of the Prestige Rune Chain is qualitatively better.

Art of the Other  
Cost: 25 SP  
Summoning, Bonding, and Binding are fundamentally three branches of one focus; the art of contracting with outside entities. Entities are split into five categories: Servitors, Egregores, Daemons, Fundamentals, and Externals. You can now see, contract, and bind these entities, the only restriction being your own knowledge and energy. Your development and energy is tied to your learning. As you begin to unravel the mechanics of different entities, you’ll be able to achieve greater and greater heights. Starting out, you will be able to summon minor Daemons and bond with fundamentals under strict contacts, but with time and experience you will become a master of the Art, weaving contracts and forces as second nature to you.

Servitors are entities created by an individual summoner, often for a singular purpose. Be that acting as a familiar, or in menial roles like timers or page turners. Being created by a summoner themselves out of their own energy reserves, they are often highly specialized, and as a result deficient in all other areas. A talented Summoner may be able to create a physically strong and capable Servitor far outstripping a human, but it would require a large amount of energy and the being would be possessed of no will or intelligence of its own, blindly following its creator’s orders to the letter.

Egregores are entities created by collective thoughts; often sourced from religions, mythologies and any figure that people funnel their faith and belief into. Comparatively to Servitors they are quite powerful, even if they do not reach the level of true gods. They derive power from the same energy they’re sourced by, often seeing the act of spreading their influence as morally correct. The power of an Egregore is directly correlated to the amount of belief and faith they consume. A local Egregore, known to very few devoted followers may be able to only summon small fires, while the conglomerated faith of a major religion could create an Egregore capable of creating vast firestorms with no strain.

Daemons are agents of the world, spirits, and entities that exist without human interference or belief. Commonly cited Daemons include fire and the ocean. Daemons, much like Egregores, scale in strength to their domain, but unlike Egregores they are not tied to humans and can theoretically persist separate from them eternally. A Daemon has complete control over their domain, but it will only act in accordance with itself. A fire cannot extinguish itself from nowhere, but it can choose how it grows and spreads. The Daemon of fire therefore has complete control over the element and everything contained within it, and is powerful to match; but incapable of fundamentally altering it. They also have their own internal structure, with Daemons of specific objects and locations deferring to their grander cousins. For instance, the Daemons of the seas, atlantic, mediterranean and further would all defer to the aforementioned Daemon of oceans.

Fundamentals are entities so intrinsic to reality that conceptualising them as entities is often foreign to non-summoners like Gravity and Time. They are difficult to control and bargain with due to their range and power, but truly embody the concepts they represent. Even the most powerful Daemon cannot truly affect the nature of its domain, while the ‘weakest’ Fundamental of entropy could completely stop its presence in a certain area, or permanently accelerate its pace on certain areas or figures.

Externals are beings completely outside reality, incomprehensible to and uncomprehending of those within its confines. They are completely alien in thought, action, and desire, and as such cannot be classified. Each can be equivalent to varying levels of entity, featuring only commonality in how unlike anything else in reality they are. General Externals vary from other-dimensional beings that cannot comprehend existence isolated to four dimensions, to Daemons of alternate worlds with physics so aberrant that they cannot be understood in the terms of their brethren.

Summoning is a discipline focused around calling these entities forth. The level of variance however is within the entities preferred by the summoner. A summoner can deal with Daemons for specific benefits, contract with larger Egregores, or summon temporary Servitors for specific purposes all within this branch of the art. The presentations of these can vary greatly, a Summoner who calls Gravity into an anomalous crushing force still contracts with a Fundamental.

Bonding however, is a summoning discipline rarely practiced by the academics studying the art. Bonding centrally allows you to form a connection with a singular entity, gaining a greater access and understanding of them and the domain they exist within. By bonding with an Egregore for instance, the great feats attributed to them are within your grasp, while bonding with a Fundamental would allow you to twist their domain as much as your skill allows. Bonding with a Fundamental of Gravity, for instance, would give you intrinsic control over local gravity, but eventually you could train this skill and learn to affect the pull of the stars themselves, though this would require great energy and learning. However, it completely warps not only your form, but also makes you unable to summon, bind or bond any other entities. You can unbond from an entity, but doing so can unleash its effects on the environment temporarily, potentially causing massive damage depending on the specific entity you bonded with. In addition, unbonding it will scour its influence from your mind, bringing you back to the level of Summoning skill you had before bonding yourself to it. As a consequence, if you ever wish to bond to the same entity you will have to relearn its influence from scratch.

Binding meanwhile, is similar in its restriction from other Summoning techniques, but it externalizes the force. Binding a Daemon to yourself ensures its service and assistance, but you do not gain benefits from its form or purpose. You can still use the Art and even Bond while Binding is in effect. In addition, when severing a Binding (which can be done on either side of the arrangement barring either extreme preparation or skill), the Summoner retains all skill in the art they gained at the cost of having less control over the entity's interpretation and action than they would have when Bonding.

Divination  
Cost: 10 SP  
You are now a master of divination magic and have a talent in all its aspects, which ranges from the simplest of detection spells all the way to viewing the future with clarity. The main way of casting divination magic is through the use of ritualistic magic, which typically has long incantations and requires certain preparations. Some basic forms of divination magic can require little to no incantations or rituals, but rituals and incantations can make them more accurate. Divination magic is divided into three main categories: past, present, and future. Beings who have strong supernatural senses can sense when someone is divining them (directly or indirectly) and if they are significantly stronger or more skilled than you even block it.

Past-based divination isn’t as widely known or used but typically involves divining an area and seeing what recently happened. The farther into the past you want to look, the cloudier and harder it gets.

Present-based divination is by far the most common and widely used. This type of divination is mainly used to detect someone in an area, improve your senses, find something, and scrying another area. This category of divination usually is less strict and requires fewer incantations or preparation.

Future-based divination is by far the most well-known and hardest type of divination. This divination gives some type of information about the future. The accuracy of your findings using future divination is based on multiple things, which include the importance of the event, your magical power, your skill, and most importantly, how far into the future you wish to know about. The less important the information and the farther in the future you wish to know, the less accurate your information is. Even the most accurate future divination magic is vague.

Lastly, you will also learn spells and how to defend against divination-based magic.  
*Fortune Teller*  
Required:Occult  
You have now mastered the most basic forms of divination magic and learned to hone them to a very high extent. This includes, but is not limited to, using a crystal ball, tarot cards, palm readings, and you have even learned to act like a medium. You also now excel at using rituals to assist in your divination magic, along with the ability to use magic to prepare the area to make your divination more effective. Lastly, as a result of your namesake, you gain a natural talent for improvisation and cold reading.

You have also been granted magically conductive implements for your basic divinations.  
*Fate Weaver*  
Required:Weaver of Destinies  
Through interacting with the Threads of Destiny, you have elevated yourself beyond the level of a mere divination mage. You are a seer, and your connection to the future is nigh absolute, making all your future divinations impossible to block or sense, excluding those connected, or disconnected, to fate itself. Not only that, but future divinations are now far easier to do and more accurate. 

Through this connection to the future, you can now naturally gain visions of important events in the near future. This also makes you naturally slightly precognitive, which manifests in a gut instinct of the future. 

Lastly, you have gained a unique and powerful ability—the ability to alter someone's fate itself. By viewing someone's thread of destiny and applying magical energy, you may change the major event in question. At first, you don't have control over how the event actually changes, but with time, you may learn to lean it in a more positive or negative direction. But the more you use this on someone, the harder it will be to use it again, and the more resistant they become to your seer abilities. Overuse on someone in a short period of time may result in them gaining a chaotic fate for a period of time, which makes their threads intangible and invisible to you, along with them being more likely to encounter a good fortune or profound misfortune.

Chaos Magic  
Cost: 10 SP  
Your magic stems from the wild, underlying forces of Chaos that shape the foundation of reality. Chaos represents both the origin of everything and the realm of infinite possibilities. As a conduit to this primordial force, you wield the power to bring forth its might.

Chaos Magic is one of the most ancient forms of magic, existing freely of the rules and traditions that bind other magics. Your spells are direct extensions of your will, and require no hand signs or incantations—merely a direction for guiding chaos into form. With a mere snap of your fingers, you could extinguish the sun or vanquish gods. Oppositely, the same spell could morph you into a flesh-eating blob, teleport you into Hell, or charm every penguin in the world.

As a conduit of primordial chaos, you can vaguely guide the intensity and direction of your spells. However, mastering the fluctuations of chaos magic is extremely difficult; even a minor misstep could lead to a minor cantrip turning into a city-breaking calamity. For Chaos mages calamity or death will always be knocking on your doorstep.

Attempting to impose order on Chaos is futile. So each spell you cast, whether to ignite a match or curse an opponent, carries the risk of a misfire. These could be mere nuisances or lethal mistakes, no chaos spell will ever follow your orders perfectly.

Chaos is disorderly, volatile, and often verges on madness, but its chaotic potential can accomplish anything—as long as you are willing to roll the dice.  
*Favored Child of Chaos*  
Required:Eliminate the Negative  
Congratulations, you have a better connection with Chaos than most across the Omniverse\! As a favored child of Chaos, your own Chaos Spells can no longer directly inconvenience, harm, or kill you—unless you desire it. You also have the power to shield those you choose from the effects of your chaos spells, though be aware: only you are the favored child, and each protective attempt increases the risks for those you protect.

While chaos cannot act directly against you, it has plenty of indirect ways to complicate your life. Enjoy wading through your bedroom transmuted turned tundras, fleeing from dragons you've unwittingly summoned, or dealing with a charmed Cthulhu you accidentally romanced. Although you are shielded from direct harm by your spells, the indirect consequences of chaos can still lead you to your doom.  
Guide the Tide  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Chaos Magic  
Chaos is a sea of possibilities, a true vortex of madness and disorder. However, your deep experience with the great Chaos has granted you the insight to guide it subtly. While Chaos cannot be ordered, you have mastered four guides to channel your Chaos spells: Attack, Defend, Move, and Control. These four broad concepts are the best way to direct chaos to achieve your desired effects.

Using any of these concepts, you can consistently steer your chaotic spells within these constraints. But, the specific effect and scale still remains chaotically bound. For instance, imbuing a Chaos spell with the concept of 'Attack' might manifest in diverse ways: it could be as harmless as a dodgeball to the face, as soul-shattering as revealing secret desires to break an opponent's mind, as annoyingly painful as summoning rubbing alcohol on every open wound, or you could even summon an elephant on top of them.  
Wild Revolver  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Chaos Magic  
Your connection with Chaos has been refined, allowing you to channel Chaos spells with even greater focus. You now possess six metaphorical 'bullets' that give direction to your Chaos spells. Each bullet ensures that your chaos spell will act within a specific direction to a certain extent. For example, a bullet used for fire will always produce fire, but the exact type—be it nuclear fire, hellfire, or sparkling glitter fire—is still left to chance. The more you try to constrain a chaos spell, the more likely it is to backfire in unexpected ways. The vaguer, the better.

These six bullets can also be used to handle any misfires. If you cast a misfire or simply dislike the outcome of your most recent spell, you can sacrifice a bullet to nullify it. However, this can only affect the spell you've most recently cast. If you wish to undo a baleful polymorph or a charmed mind flayer spell you cast months ago, good luck. Indirect consequences of your spells aren't nullified either so don't think you can get away scot free if you accidentally summon Godzilla on top of the White House.

The revolver's bullets replenish at a rate of one bullet every 10 minutes but frequent casting of Chaos spells will enhance your reload time. With time and practice, you can gain more 'bullets' to direct your chaos spells more effectively.

Celestial Current  
Cost: 25 SP  
Long ago, an ancient civilization sought to use the energy of a dying star to empower their race and escape their inevitable demise. Their brightest minds worked together and found a way to infuse aether \- a special type of solar energy, into their very bodies. They managed to transfer a portion of their consciousness into a state of living, hyperdense aether which was able to transmit information back to their bodies. They named this new form of existence the soul.  
Utilizing their newfound souls, they were able to achieve a variety of spectacular effects. Aether was an extremely potent and versatile form of energy capable of interacting with and even diluting into a variety of particles. Through careful calculations and mastery of physics, a formula could be created. A formula is an extremely specific series of actions involving manipulation, flow, and transfer of aether in order to create an effect on the physical world.

The most basic formula is manifesting aether externally in an unstable state to rapidly fire beams of scorching hot aether. However, from this foundation, more complex formulas can be developed, allowing for intermediate uses such as elemental control, teleportation, telekinesis, and flight equivalent to your maximum running speed.  
Advanced users of aether have extreme fine control of the energy, and can utilize the continuous transfer of aether between their soul and body to achieve effects such as complete and rapid regeneration of the body and reinforcing the body (and weapons) with aether. At the theoretical height of aether manipulation lies the ability to control the very fabrics of the world, shaping time and creating aetherial stars with ease.

Aether is capable of assimilating other energies and forms of mana into itself, gaining their properties and capabilities. Though it is important to be careful, as you are essentially modifying the fabric of your own soul when you do this.  
You start at the level of a beginner mage, capable of materialising aether rays and some basic forms of elemental manipulation. Your mind is enhanced to the level of a high-end computer in order to facilitate this level of aether use. Your soul passively generates aether for your use, but you can convert other forms of energy such as radiation and sunlight into aether, which will replenish your reserves. Regularly absorbing external aether can increase your maximum capacity \-- if you somehow survive an extended stay at the core of a star your aether regeneration and reserves will become monstrous.  
(With enough time you can do anything with this power)

Tattoo Genesis  
Cost: 25 SP  
You possess a unique form of magic that harnesses the power of tattoos, allowing you to create and draw strength from them. Your magical reservoir can be channeled to either craft new tattoos or activate existing ones. The complexity and size of a tattoo directly correlate with the energy required for its creation or activation.

For instance, a simple snake tattoo on your arm might grant you the ability to summon a serpent, while a full-body dragon tattoo could potentially enable you to transform into a dragon. The type of power you gain from the tattoo is dependent on your understanding of what the tattoo symbolises, for example you may gain the power to control fire from a fire tattoo, while others may gain the power to summon fire spirits.

If your energy reserves are insufficient, the magic will draw from other sources, including your life force if necessary. Additionally, you have the ability to bestow tattoos upon others, sharing your powers with them.  
If you have other powers you can imbue them into your tattoos.  
*Infinite Recursion*  
Required:Brand & Bond  
recursive text on the inside of an O. Forever dOwnwards.Forever dOwnwards.

Your tattoos as created with Tattoo Genesis have fused with the Brand & Bond, allowing you to will your tattoos into smaller and more complex forms. The size of your tattoos can now be greatly compressed, compensating for the lack of size with recursive detail.

Codex Esoterica  
Cost: 25 SP  
You have the ability to summon an extra-dimensional scroll of power and knowledge and unsummon it at any time.  
Within this scroll of magic you find a nearly endless collection of magical systems of all different varieties and potencies, while there is a wide variety of systems that are contained within this single scroll all of them follow a similar pattern in several ways.  
The magic systems of this scroll all have some amount of power progression, reaching higher levels of mastery and effectiveness through study and practical work in the system.  
The Magic systems work off of internal principles or laws that can be studied and understood allowing the dedicated to progress far. There could be the laws of Mana interactions or an elemental cycle that can be studied and modelled accurately. The level of detail and depth of the fields of study are determined by the strength and depth of the magic system itself. This restriction doesn't mean that all of the magical systems are highly scientific or "physical" just that there are actual rules and internal logic that has to be followed for it to work.

If the Magic system needs some form of special trait or condition that you do not have, the system will have a method to develop them. This might mean that the early stages of progression in a system require you to work only on developing those special traits, but all of the magic systems can be progressed through your hard work and dedication.

For a magic system with external resource needs they might rely on specialized magic sub-systems for a specific external resource, multiple magic systems might use the same or similar sub-systems. External resources don't have to be consumable, and could be something like a magical Foci.  
While a lot of magic systems use some kind of internal energy source, not all of them do some take the form of spell slots, or even Trading card game like cards, however in some way there will be a resource economy that means your system has some form of limits that requires intelligent management .

You begin with one magic system for free that would be the equivalent of 20sp power, this would be at the high end of street level powers, as you study and further your understanding of your current magic system you build up energy within the scroll. The energy is expended to check out another magic system.  
While actively studying and practicing with your magic system you have access to a Tutor that is focused on the specific Magic system you are studying. This tutor isn't sapient or sentient and while it can act with specifically chosen personality and mannerisms, it doesn't know much else beyond its magic system. The tutor is specifically enchanted to be able to figure out methods of teaching that actually work for you. The Tutor cannot be used to shortcut your work or path to power.

Your ability to gain access to another Magic system is locked until you reach what would be a moderate, or journeyman level of power, in the magic system, even if you have enough energy built up. You can however gain access to any subsystems your unlocked magical systems reference.  
When you select a magic system you will mentally transmit a search for the kind of magic system you are looking for, you can specify the kinds of effects that can be produced, or what kind of requirements the system has, even an energy cost range for it so you know what you have the budget for.  
If you are in a world that has a magic system that would fit the Codex Systematica then it is an option you can specifically search for and acquire at a discount.  
When you reach levels of mastery within a system, you can begin to syncretize it with magic systems that have similarities or synergistic interactions, allowing for a boost to the effectiveness of combined principles or laws, and smoothing over contradictory interactions that increases the further you are into mastery.

Witch of the Void  
Cost: 25 SP  
You are a witch who finds themselves mysteriously linked to the unfathomable concept of the void, where all things end, and ordinarily, mere contact with this void results in death. Your power stems from a realm lurking beneath the fabric of existence, representing Entropy and Death. Through this connection, You have acquired proficiency in the arcane arts of the darker magical disciplines. You will be able to fire a Void Blast that can be fired as a beam, wave, or general blast. You will also gain increased proficiency in energy manipulation and necromancy.  
Furthermore, You possess entry to a secluded dimension, out of sync with reality, that acts as a Prison. This realm serves as confinement; any entity You encase within the Prison becomes incapable of escape unless those imprisoned surpass your strength or seek external assistance. Your ability to teleport allows you to travel anywhere on the planet you currently reside on in a flash of purple light.  
It's important to acknowledge that beings connected to life or those opposed to entropy instinctively fear you. They can sense your connection to the concepts of entropy and death, prompting an aversion towards any association with you. This drawback, however, can be mitigated through dedicated time and effort. Additionally, you are immune to the natural progression of aging or succumbing to illness. Also, Excessive use of your powers will lead to weariness and lethargy.  
Entry To The Void  
Cost: 25 SP  
Required:Witch of the Void  
You now possess a heightened connection to the Void, allowing you to access it at will. This newfound connection enables you to turn your prison realm into a personal enclave within the Void, which you can designate as your Domain. You can extend invitations to others, allowing them to seek refuge within your Domain. However, this invitation comes with a protective blessing that shields them from the adverse effects of the Void. The Domain will be the size of a small city.

Within the confines of the Void, you are impervious to hostile entities that may venture into it as they succumb to the Void's effects and are erased. Nevertheless, the Void remains neutral and does not actively ensure your survival. You'll need protection or immortality to ensure you're safe.

Constant vigilance is essential for safeguarding your Domain, as it faces ongoing threats from the natural monsters dwelling within the Void.  
Furthermore, your newfound ability to traverse the Void enables you to journey through it effortlessly, granting you access to any world near you within the multiverse you are currently in; note this does not give you full access to the multiverse, just a few worlds. All your Magic and Spells will be significantly enhanced.  
Child Of The Void  
Cost: 30 SP  
Required:Entry To The Void  
Your connection to the Void has ascended to its pinnacle. No longer just a mere Witch, you have transcended into a Child of the Void itself. The Void now pledges its unwavering support, ready to assist you whenever needed.

Your dominion has transformed into a regal Kingdom, a haven for the abandoned, forgotten, and exiled. These residents have undergone a metamorphosis, evolving into a unique race known as the Voidlings.  
Your capacity for traversing realms has been enhanced, allowing you to journey to any corner of the multiverse you are currently in; with time, effort, and training, you will eventually be able to use the void to travel through the Omniverse.

Your soul has merged with the essence of the Void, embodying entropy and death. As a result, the spectre of mortality eludes you, making it so that even if you somehow die, you will reform inside your domain.

Finally, when traveling outside your Domain or the void, most of your power will be sealed away because your full aura and presence warps reality; you can unseal your power for a short time if needed. Your Spells, specifically your Void blast, will now erase anything conceptually; any spell you can cast may be enhanced by concepts.

Enchanting Mastery  
Cost: 15 SP  
Enchanting Mastery grants you the ability to infuse everyday objects with magical properties, enhance their existing qualities, and craft reagents from mundane items through specialized rituals. With this power, you can create items that would boggle the mind through focusing your intent to imbue items. Through the art of inscribing intricate magical runes or symbols, you can enhance an item's durability, amplify its damage, grant it protection against specific elements, and achieve many other effects.

As a master of enchanting, your expertise extends to the crafting of mystical reagents. Utilizing specialized rituals, you can transform commonplace materials into potent magical substances, further expanding the possibilities of your enchanting abilities. You can also incorporate crystals or gemstones into your rituals to augment the potency of your creations.

The end result is an item imbued with unique, fantastical abilities. Whether it's a cloak that grants the wearer temporary invisibility while worn or a ring that eliminates the need for sleep, your enchanted creations are limited only by your imagination and materials. One unique feature of this ability is the ability to establish activation mechanisms for the enchantment and/or item. For example, only a specific person may use the item, or it can only be activated during the day.  
*Set Effect*  
Required:Street Warrior  
Through enchanting, you can now create set items with a multitude of effects. Set items offer two main bonuses: first, they have a set effect; second, they function as a single item for the purposes of any beneficial magic, power, or other ability.

There are two primary methods for creating set items. The first method is far weaker but significantly simpler and less expensive. It involves simultaneously enchanting several items, resulting in a weaker set effect and weaker enchantments than usual. The strength of the enchantments is directly related to the number of enchanted objects; the more enchanted objects at once, the weaker the enchantments become. Enchanting too many items at once may render them completely worthless or even result in failure.

The second approach involves enchanting each object separately in two ways: either enchanting them all with the same enchantments, which provides a weaker set effect, or enchanting them with complementary effects. Regardless of the way you enchant using the second approach, you will need to perform a ritual to join all of them. If your items are metaphysically incompatible, the ritual may fail and destroy them all. However, if you succeed, the enchantments will reinforce one another, providing a stronger set effect based on their compatibility. This method theoretically allows you to have an infinite number of objects in a set effect, but the likelihood of failure rises as you add more items.

Biomancy  
Cost: 15 SP  
You have awakened a trace, a fragment, of magical power; your biological makeup has changed to withstand the nature of magic. All magus who practice the thaumaturgical nature of biomancy possess an organic flesh sack inside their bodies that helps with the gathering of the vestiges of the lifeblood of the universe. Those who practice possess a more evolved body as a result of the mutations that they gain from casting spells or the backlash from spells that have forever scarred their body.

You start with a beginner-level understanding of the main branches of biomancy; however, through experimentation and research, you can branch outside the current understanding of biomancy.

Shaping: When most people picture those who work with flesh, you are the first thing their mind goes to. This is the school of manipulating the flesh of beings who are still alive and even those who are dead in order to change the bodies of the living into something else, using magic to influence the evolution and creation of flesh into something that it was not before. You are able to cast magic and change the biology of others and yourself, augmenting the already existing biology. Others are often able to tell those who practice this type of magic based on how they look, as those who delve into shaping often leave differently than how they came in, grafting additional arms, eyes, or even growing tentacles in order to attack offensively. Most people do not wish to get into a fight with Shapers, as they will turn them into biomass that they will then use to further augment themselves.

Monster Manipulation: This is the school of magic relating to the creation of new life and a subsection of Shaping. Those who practice this magic are fond of creating monsters instead of augmenting themselves, distancing themselves from combat, not wanting to dirty themselves with the blood of their enemies, and creating elaborate monsters to do the job for them, such as bears that can breathe fire, dragons that can turn invincible, snakes with the upper body of a man that can poison their enemies, and so much more. The more imaginative the one who created the monster, the more features that could be hidden in the monster that they created. They are not bound by the biological laws of the universe, being able to fit more into their creations the more they have spent researching this branch of magic, even creating all new forms of beings that have abilities beyond what normal biology should allow.

Blight Craft: The first plague that was ever discovered was the result of a biomancer who did not properly seal the container that they kept their research in. This field of study is that of transmuting flesh into diseases and plagues, able to create plagues that even the most deadly of creatures could fall into. Creating parasites and diseases comes as second nature; you are able to create diseases that shouldn't exist with enough research and study, corrupting others into misshapen blobs of flesh, turning their eyes into bees, creating boils, and so much more.

As you progress into biomancy, you can start to crate biological monsters with magic alone instead of relying on already existing biomass, creating abominations that evolve the more magic that you put into them. At mastery, you could even start to shape the world around you as you reach beyond the limits of mortal biology.

Illusion Magic  
Cost: 20 SP  
You are a master of the school of illusion, this ranges from minor tricks and misdirection, all the way to fooling the perception of reality itself.  
You focus on the magic of perception itself, creating lies so good they might as well be truth, hiding in plain sight the fantastical, or fooling the senses to perceive the impossible in the mundane, But not only the mental aspect of this magic is open to you, the physical is as well, craft puppets made of light and shadow, overlay a differing reality upon this one, or even fool memories, creating lifetimes, experiences and sensations in people, making them question the very fabric of the world around them.  
The grand art of this school of magic is the lie so great it fools all the world, turning lie and fiction into truth, and overwriting reality. This is far beyond you as of right now, but with time and effort you may be able to accomplish this. Just remember if you hit the universe, the universe tends to try and hit back, so trying to turn your thought to reality incurs an enormous cost, whether that be by magical energies, or if you are unable to pay with that, physical ones, even including lifespan.

Radiant Painter  
Cost: 20 SP  
You are a radiant painter, by infusing both your materials and yourself with magical energies you can create magical and mystical creations of Art. At first you will only be able to apply a small amount of magic through your works, creating minor effects like illusions or emotional stimulation in those who are near the work of Art. But with time and with special material and mystical perpetrations you can imbue an incredible amount of magic into your works, which would put a whole city into a dreamscape, or turn a small backyard garden into a backyard jungle that slowly consumes the town.

You have the ability to create a wide variety of artistic mediums, gaining the knowledge of how to create any kind mundane artistic medium, the infusion of materials can take many forms based on your personal style of magic, but compounding infused materials with other infused materials increases the infused magic amount multiplicatively.

You can create a wide variety of handcrafted artistic works that create magical effects based on the intent and design of the work of Art. With enough practice and experimentation you could achieve a wide range of effects as long as they are all centered on the work of art itself. It's strengths lay in area effects and requires a skilled artist to create complex functions or conditions within the works of art, working at its peak when indiscriminate in effect, as the painter you can choose to be completely immune from the effects of your creations.

Magical Melody  
Cost: 20 SP  
Curios, you seem to have been blessed utterly by music.  
Your skill as a composer and performer of music has reached legendary status, and you can translate any feeling, idea, or concept into a song evoking these things.  
You also possess the ability to summon and telekinetically utilize to the peak of your abilities any instruments you desire or need, no matter how expensive or rare. Have your orchestra be staffed entirely by Stradivarius violins if you so desire.  
However the true power of this is revealed when you channel these feelings into your pieces with the intent to cause change in the world around you. As your blessing has touched the realm of magic, through the medium of music you can cause magical and mystical effects tied to the song and the things it evokes. A raging song evoking a storm or the wrath of the heavens might summon up said storm, a quiet contemplative piece might enhance the learning capabilities of everyone who hears it. A nostalgic sorrowful piece could soften the heart and ease the burdens of those it reaches.  
The sky's the limit so to speak, as the things you evoke and represent with the primordial language of sounds reach out and persuade the world to change through pure emotion. This is an old and powerful branch of magic, tracing its roots all the way through Orpheus and Solomon, and even deeper into mankind's primordial past, and beyond.  
Rap God  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Magical Melody  
Your beautiful voice has gained an alternative twisted oppression. Every word you speak can psychically create ravings. Ravings are various messages, words, and phrases that only the victim can hear, with a supernatural ability to cause madness. You can choose the exact wording of the ravings, as long as they are loosely related to yourself (notable locations, your philosophy, songs you have created, or even your pet's name). The exact number of words has no effect on the power of the raving, you can have a simple annoying catchphrase or thousands of maddening sounds overlapping at once with the same degree of corruption.

The speed at which a target afflicted with ravings goes insane and duration of the ravings depends on their relative power level and their mental/soul defenses. Ravings have no effect on someone on your strength level, but a civilian without mental protections would immediately become a fanatical worshipper with a single word from you. Someone with decent mental protections will still take permanent damage if they are far weaker than you, and will experience effects such as seeing things they shouldn't see or hearing things they shouldn't hear. These effects will make it easier to corrupt them further in the future.

Furthermore, your melodies also gain some additional improvements. You can now channel your ravings through a melody, which can afflict everyone in a large radius. You can also somewhat control the exact mental effects by changing the lyrics of the song, though they all generally trend to become more fanatical towards you.

Finally, your music gains the ability to cleanse corruption of all kinds. Songs created by you naturally cleanse mental pollution, cure eldritch madness, and rejuvenate the souls of those who hear it. The effect isn't very strong, but can quickly add up over multiple doses. Songs which take advantage of this cannot cause ravings.

Necromancy  
Cost: 0 SP  
Necromancy, undeath or death magic to some, is the darkest of all magic. Most of the magic in this field of the arcane focuses on the manipulation of the dead and the souls of the living. You wield the darkest of all black magic. Harvesting the leftover parts of the world to reanimate the dead requires three resources that are essential for necromancy: vitae (the life force of humans), the remains of the dead, and entropy. Wielding all three, you cast spells that change the world around you to come closer to death or reanimate those close to death.

You start with beginner-level spells in the three main branches of necromancy; however you are not limited to these branches.

Undead manipulation: what most people assume necromancy is all about is being able to raise the dead, whether they be skeletons, zombies, spirits, or just about any other type of undead creature. There is no limit to what you can raise to become part of your undead legion. You may have any number of undead servants at a time, taking no Vitae for them to linger but only what it costs to resurrect them. You gain a mental link with every undead that you create that allows you to assume direct control over them as the overlord of a hivemind of undead minions. So long as they fit within the theme of being undead, you can bring someone back into various forms, such as mummies or vampires that possess abilities similar to their fantasy counterparts, such as a lich being able to resurrect the dead as a general or possessing a phylactery.

Curse manipulation: You are proficient in curses, being able to use many curses that slow, weaken, cause misfortune, Blindness, petrification, Drain energy, and even cause damage to those you curse. All curses you cast are permanent unless the one you cast them on is stronger than you. This magic uses entropy in a more focused fashion than any other branch of necromancy. You start with basic spells such as slow, blinding, and corpse explode.

Soul manipulation: you are able to manipulate souls and the life force of others. Creating and shaping the souls in any way you wish is possible so long as you possess souls, both the ones you are manipulating and the ones you use to feed your energy. To start down the path, you must possess an understanding of your own soul. The more you grow this branch of necromancy, the more you can shape the world around you or absorb the souls of others, creating monsters, converting souls to energy, absorbing them to gain power the person once possessed, creating souls from nothing, even forging souls into armor, and so much more.

At later stages of necromancy, you can even start manipulating those who are not dead, shaping flesh, and creating new species from magic alone, creating abominations from those still alive or dead that are loyal only to you. At mastery, you can even reverse the flow of entropy and instead focus it into your undead creations, evolving them to no longer be dead but instead a half-step between death and life, allowing them to grow past what they once were.

Magicbabble  
Cost: 30 SP  
With this power, you possess the ability to perform limitless magic. You can unleash fireballs, unlock locks, manipulate minds, or even attain godlike powers with Omnipotence and Omniscience. However, every spell requires you to perform specific actions or utter special words, similar to the excuses made in sci-fi shows to explain advanced technology. You must wave objects, chant incantations, or perform rituals to manifest the desired magical effect.

While any spell is possible, each has its own requirements. Simple spells may only need gestures or brief incantations, while complex ones demand elaborate rituals and sacrifices. You possess a general understanding of the necessary steps to achieve your goals, and different magical systems can aid your Magicbabble power. For instance, a fire spell cast with a wand may require fewer gestures, and a potion might require fewer ingredients if they possess magical properties. Moreover, you have an innate talent for learning and mastering various magical systems across the multiverse.

Spiritual Magician  
Cost: 15 SP  
You are a magician of Soul. You have necessary knowledge to detect, manipulate and destroy souls, summon and bind spiritual creatures, summon souls that were long dead, and call upon the spirits of nature for help. With sufficient time, you can create souls ex nihilo, awaken soul inside non-spiritual and alien beings granting them human thoughts, create elemental spirits by infusing soul in various natural and conceptual elements, remove the concept of death from your soul making it immortal, and much more.

Blood Magic  
Cost: 15 SP  
Sanguimancy, or hemomancy to some, is a highly contested magic that is often seen as a dark art. However, blood magic is no more dark magic than any other magic; indeed, that could not be further from the truth. Blood magic is one of the purest forms of magic that one can achieve, as it is the oldest magic to exist since time immemorial, before the void that existed before the universe. However, it also costs more than many would be willing to pay, as the more taxing a spell is, the more likely it is that you will die from blood loss and your life force being drained as it is used as fuel for arcane reality manipulation.

To learn more spells, the practitioner must perform a spell to reach through time, reach the void, and look into it as the very nature of the universe is revealed to them. Oftentimes leaving the recipient blind for the next few minutes due to the overstimulation of looking so far into the past and learning things that mortal minds should not have understood.

If one thing is to be certain, the scholars of old have learned that nothing is ever free, and everything comes at a cost; the only question is if you are willing to pay the price.  
(This power essentially allows you to do anything with enough research and preparation.)

*Sanguimancy of the Elders*  
Required:Echoes of the Void  
Due to possessing the blood of an Elder, your existence has changed. And, thanks to this change, your capacity to use Blood Magic has now escalated exponentially.  
A powerful ritual that might have previously drained you of your life force entirely would now only require a single drop of your valuable eldritch blood. And, as you further transform into an Elder, the potency of your blood will only increase over time. This means that you'll be able to cast more frequent or more powerful spells for less of a sacrifice until eventually, you can effectively cast such spells at will.  
Furthermore, as the Elders are primordial creatures, coming into existence before the universe itself, your mind has adapted to comprehend the ancient eldritch spells and rituals behind Blood Magic with far greater ease than before.

Libriomancer  
Cost: 30 SP  
Harness the extraordinary power of Libriomancy and become a master of manipulating the enchantment contained within the written word. As a Libriomancer, you possess an understanding of the magical potential hidden within books, granting you the ability to draw forth their contents and bring them to life in the real world.

The strength of your Libriomancy is influenced by the popularity and significance of the book or story you draw from. The more widely known and beloved the work, the easier it is for you to access its magic and wield its creations. Famous literary classics, beloved bestsellers, and iconic stories hold immense power within their pages, serving as a wellspring for your abilities.

However, the magic of Libriomancy has its limitations. Each book possesses a finite amount of magical energy that can be tapped into before it needs time to recharge. You can only use Libriomancy on a specific book a limited number of times before it requires a period of rest and rejuvenation. This restriction encourages you to explore a vast array of literature and discover new sources within different books.

Your mastery of Libriomancy extends beyond traditional printed books, allowing you to tap into the enchantment of other literary forms. Comics and manga come alive as vibrant illustrations leap from the pages, while digital e-books unravel their mystical potential, blurring the boundaries between the physical and virtual realms.

Your connection to the written word unlocks endless possibilities, enabling you to summon weapons, creatures, and objects to aid you on your quests. However, remember the delicate balance between fiction and reality, and exercise caution when altering the fabric of stories, as the consequences can be unpredictable.

Mystic Eyes of Fantasy  
Cost: 30 SP  
You possess a pair of unique mystic eyes that can alter reality, turning falsehoods into truths and fiction into fact, rejecting reality and substituting your own. These eyes allow you to deceive the fabric and tapestry of the \[world\] itself, forcing it to have no choice but to accept your reality as its own.

Each of your eyes holds a distinct ability within, working in unison to bring your illusions to life.

The right eye wields the power of the Lie, the act of lying to the face of the universe, transforming rumors and falsehoods into truths. The more believable and widespread the lie, the easier it is to manifest and the longer it can persist in reality, softening the impact on yourself. If a lie is sustained for long enough, that lie will eventually become a permanent Truth, turning fleeting illusions into fact.

The left eye embodies Rejection, the act of denial against reality, capable of negating a singular Truth of the world at a time, altering how reality is perceived. However, the more fundamental or universally accepted the fact you're rejecting is, the harder it becomes to erase it from both your mind and the world around you. The strain to maintain this illusion intensifies with the magnitude of the truth you're defying—Greater Truths will have the potential to overwhelm or even kill you if you're not careful.

As you wield these eyes, you will find your abilities blossoming with time, gradually expanding their reach while the burden they place upon you begins to ease. Though the weaknesses inherent to their power can never truly be cast aside, they will become far more manageable, growing far more tolerable as your mastery deepens. With each step forward, the strain becomes a distant dream, and the weight of their gift will rest lighter upon your soul.

### Spiritual and Divine

Ignited Soul  
Cost: 15 SP  
Your Soul has been brought before the weight of reality and withstood it, thus Igniting it. This Ignition allows you to produce and store Soul Energy in endless amounts inside your Soul. Soul Energy can be utilized in a nigh-endless amount of way with enough experience, these expressions of your Soul are known as Arts. Initially, you are able to condense your Soul into a weapon of your own design, this weapon can be used beyond to influence reality using the weight of your Soul. You are also able to infuse your body with your Soul Energy, increasing all of your physical and mental attributes tremendously. Infusing your body can delay your aging, eventually progressing to the point of immortality, replacing all your bodily and mental faculties with your Soul. The amount of Soul Energy you produce increases as you use your Soul and grows qualitatively as you perform incredible feats, each feat, also known as Soul Feats, grant you a new ability related to the experience. The ability gained can be active or passive, and truly heroic acts may even grant both.  
Adaptive Spark  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Ignited Soul  
Your Soul Energy is now able to replicate other supernatural energies through your Soul Arts. This replication requires both enough exposure and understanding of the energy you wish to imitate. In addition to this newfound replication capacity, your ability to manipulate your Soul Energy is prodigious. This instinctual level of manipulation allows you to create new Soul Arts with ease, and enables incredible control over the fine details of each individual Art. Soul Arts can individually develop further applications as you gain more experience and put more Soul Energy into them. All of your Soul Arts improve as you make history and break new ground with their use, additionally, all Soul Arts are now self-correcting, fixing imperfections in their foundations and removing inefficiencies even while not in use.  
Soul Successor  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Ignited Soul  
Your Soul can light a Spark inside of other individuals. This Spark grants them the potential to Ignite their Soul. Understand that just because you are able to grant an individual the potential to Ignite, they are not guaranteed to. If left to their own devices, most individuals will be unable to comprehend what it means to break down all that you are and Ignite your Soul from the remnants. Through your help, almost anyone will be able to go through the Ignition process. For every successful Ignition, you receive a Soul Trait, these Traits will give an active and passive ability that is individualized for every being that has been through a successful Ignition as a result of your Spark. Every time you help a Soul through a successful Ignition, you gain a new fount of Soul Energy that grows alongside the main production of your Soul.  
Soul Manifestation  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Ignited Soul  
No longer are you condensing your Soul into a mere weapon. You are able to partially manifest your Ignited Soul itself onto reality, taking on whatever appearance you wish. Your Manifestation is able to be separated from you for an indefinite duration, although you are able to recall it at will. This Manifestation holds the crystallized benefits of all of your accomplishments inside of it. Defeating challenging or unique beings, slaying numerous enemies of a type, repeating signature Soul Art, all of these are ways you can both unlock new abilities and increase the one you have. Your Manifestation has the same unlimited potential for growth that your Soul, additionally, your Manifestation will never lag behind your maximum power. With enough practice you will be able to manifest enough of your Soul to temporarily replace a small portion of reality with your Soul, allowing you to use your Soul Arts to affect reality at a much larger scale.  
Incarnation Armament  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Ignited Soul  
Your ability to infuse your body with your body will your Soul Energy has both increased by a magnitude and qualitatively improved. Soul Energy can now be condensed at-will into a set of Soul Armor that scales with you in all ways. This Armor has an innate adaptive defense, growing increasingly resistant to all forms of damage as it experiences them. This resistance will grow into an immunity once you achieve enough Soul Feats for surviving a specific form of damage. Soul Arts of the physical realm come to you naturally, taking dozens of steps at once, diverting rivers with the slice of a hand, molding magma with your bare hands, all of these Arts and many many more can be created with ease. Manipulating your own momentum, density, weight, and size can be done, allowing you to become either the immovable object, the unstoppable force, or even both at the same time, regardless of how much of a paradox it might be.  
Immortal Ignition  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required:Ignited Soul  
Your Immortal Soul has been ignited, making it absolutely and completely immortal. Nothing is able to damage, manipulate, drain, or copy your Soul, as it will always regenerate to its peak condition. Your body and mind are merely your Soul being physically projected onto reality, allowing you to change your appearance, age, race, and all other physical attributes at will. The amount of Soul Energy you produce every moment is astounding, at no point will you ever have to worry about truly running out of energy. The difficulty required for your feats to grant you abilities has been lowered tremendously, and every feat is now guaranteed to grant you both an active and passive ability.

Benevolence Of Primordial Agony  
Cost: 50 SP  
For reasons beyond comprehension, the essence of omniversal pain has chosen you as its singular obsession.

This unconditional love manifests in a simple way. Any act intended to harm you, whether physical or mental, regardless of the perpetrator's intent, nature, or attempts to conceal it—whether by a sentient being or an inanimate object, regardless of their power or origins—will be immediately confronted with the pure essence of pain. The likelihood of the act succeeding in harming you directly correlates with the intensity and paralyzing effect of the pain experienced by the perpetrator. This pain can reach such excruciating levels that even entities incapable of even comprehending pain will pass out instantly upon experiencing it. If, by some divine miracle, they manage to wound you, the primordial fury of pain will descend upon them. This pain will transcend flesh and bone, soul and mind, affecting all members of their species. The only way to stop this ever-present curse is through the death of the perpetrator or the extermination of their entire species. The pain entity can differentiate between malicious harm and benevolent acts; for example, a doctor performing surgery to improve your health will not be subjected to pain.  
This phenomenon virtually has no range; as long as you are in your local omniverse, this concept will always accompany you. In normal circumstances, the pain will start to subside when the harmful act towards you diminishes. You may also plead with the primordial entity to dismiss the pain, which it will do on most occasions only if it believes you can manage the threat involved.

Deathlord  
Cost: 40 SP  
Now existing in a state between life and death, you are an immortal being, perpetually maintaining a pale youthful appearance. You don't feel pain, and you are impervious to all forms of injuries, with your flesh, organs, and bones seamlessly mending themselves almost instantaneously, regardless of severity. This bizarre condition also extends to grant you full control over your movements and an impeccable sense of balance, enabling you to initiate any action with utmost efficiency. But your power doesn't end there.  
You can instantly summon and dismiss a weightless Scythe, its aesthetic appearance tailored to your preferences. A pure manifestation of your soul, this weapon is indestructible, with sharpness that allows it to cut through nearly anything, but its true power lies in the supernatural ability to steal the souls of those it kills.  
When your Scythe claims a living being, you are presented with two choices regarding their soul. You can either fully siphon the soul for yourself, enhancing your physical attributes based on the strength of the soul, with this self enhancing cycle having no limits, or summon/dismiss the soul into the physical realm as a perfectly loyal servant. These servants retain their powers, skills, experiences, and memories intact from before their demise at your hands. There are no limits to the number of servants you can command, and if vanquished you can summon them again after 24 hrs.  
Also whether through your connection to the after-life, or something else entirely, you have the power to manipulate the speech of others. This control extends to muting them, compelling them to speak words of your choosing, or even making them converse in an entirely different language. The targeted individuals find themselves entirely unable to control their mouths and tongues, compelled to move or remain still according to your will.  
You start off with the physical attributes of an ordinary human being.  
Icy Abyss  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Deathlord  
Your scythe now offers a third option upon claiming a soul, the ability to conjure and manipulate ice.

Initially, you possess no control or connection to this element. However, as you invest the harvested souls into this option, its power, range, and versatility will gradually increase. With a sufficient investment of souls, you can freeze even abstract concepts, extending your reach to encompass entire planets.

Beloved of the Gods  
Cost: 25 SP  
Gods, spirits, eldritch abominations, and more always seem to mess with or help humans with a price thrown in. Somehow you’re able to converse with any god or beings of supernatural nature.

Merely calling out their name and asking for a sit down will result in a conversation as long as there is a truce between the two of you. The talk can be about anything from forming a contract, and gathering power, to merely having someone to talk to on those lonely nights. Don’t try to ask the crazy ones to help you with ‘personal body’ troubles. Trust me you don’t want to stick it in eldritch crazy. We have enough demigods and half-supernatural spawn already from people getting frisky with the freaky.

Anyway even the most vile of gods and abominations that wish to erase humanity are surprisingly willing to talk so long as you mean no harm. They won’t manipulate, hurt, or do anything negative to you and will even help you out provided they get something of equal value out of the deal. Afterward, they will still have a humanity hate boner but you’ll pique enough interest that they’ll decide to spare you. This mercy is rescinded if you agitate them enough.

Gods and beings that are neutral or heaven forbid benevolent towards humans will help you out free of charge in any way they can. They’ll keep tabs on you as you’re of special interest and will often give you things that they reserve for their champions such as blessings, items of power, etc. When it comes to being a god’s best friend no one seems to be better for the role than you.

Guardian Angel  
Cost: 40 SP  
You now find yourself with a powerful Guardian Angel, forever unconditionally committed to your protection, and this bond can never be broken under no influence, not even yours.

This highly intelligent and sentient being has the potential to develop a distinct personality if you so allow it. A telepathic link connects you both effortlessly, enabling seamless communication across any distance. The physical manifestation of your Guardian Angel adapts to your aesthetic preferences while aligning its morals and worldview with yours.

With a conceptual link to protection, this entity will always surpasses your capabilities by a factor of 25 in every conceivable way, with an enhanced passive growth that further strengthens it, the more its abilities are utilized. This entity also has six unique abilities dedicated to ensuring your safety:

Elemental Manipulation: The capacity to fully conjure and manipulate one of the four main elements (fire, earth, water, air) of your choosing.

Divine Shields: The ability to instantly summon nigh-impregnable opaque shields of varying sizes and shapes.

Unseen Retribution: The power to turn invisible and undetectable by all except yourself.

Healing Touch: Proficiency in healing and rejuvenation—able to mend wounds, cure diseases, and fully restore lost limbs and damaged internal organs within minutes.

Flight Of The Valkyrie: The ability to soar through the skies, effortlessly gliding and levitating. Their flight speed can escalate from stillness to hypersonic in seconds, all while maintaining exceptional maneuverability. The existence of actual wings is left up to you.

Sword of Absolution: A pure manifestation of the concept of protection, acting as your Guardian Angel's strongest trump card. Its sharpness intensifies with the degree of danger towards you, reaching a point where it can irreversibly cut through anything.

Free from the need for sustenance and immune to fatigue, your Guardian Angel, if vanquished, retreats into your soul for a 24-hour regeneration period before reappearing again at full capacity. While naturally inclined to be in your proximity 24/7, it is at your command to faithfully fulfil any other tasks you require. If the host has died, the Guardian Angel has 24 hours to resurrect them, or they will perish as well.  
Sacred Guardian  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:Guardian Angel  
Your guardian's overall power has surged, bringing forth four additional abilities, thus totaling ten unique powers.

Protector's Wrath: A 20-minute buff, with a 24-hour cooldown, multiplying all its stats by a factor of 5\.

Scope of Dogma: Their eyes undergo a transformative change, granting them the ability to see a person's complete profile— from physical characteristics, abilities, skills, powers, and even their intentions or ulterior motives.

Prime Directive: With their deep connection to the concept of protection, your guardian can establish three rules that the target(s) must adhere to. Violating these rules incurs stackable benefits for your angel:

Rule 1: Do not harm the host. Breaking it boosts the Guardian Angel's overall power by 30%.  
Rule 2: Do not harbor harmful ulterior motives towards the host. Breaking it debuffs the target's overall power by 30%.  
Rule 3: Do not attempt to obstruct the Guardian Angel in protecting their host. Breaking it enables the Guardian Angel to enhance the power of one of their abilities by 50%.

These rules will still take effect, whether or not the target(s) is aware of them.  
Infinite Impermanence: Leveraging their Scope of Dogma, the Guardian Angel can seal and negate a skill, ability, or power. The Guardian may unseal it, whenever they see fit, or if you tell them to.  
Any harm directed towards your Guardian Angel is interpreted as harm directed towards their host. Consequently, they benefit from any abilities that utilize this connection, such as Prime Directive, and Sword of Absolution. In the event of the host's demise, for a duration of 24 hours, the Guardian Angel will undergo a remarkable buff of 200% in every conceivable aspect.  
Divine Guardian  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:Sacred Guardian  
Your guardian angel further gains five abilities, totaling to fifteen.

Sacrificial Pawn: When either the host or the Guardian faces imminent death, another designated life form will perish in their place, no matter where they are. For this ability to take effect, the Guardian Angel must establish a pre-arranged agreement with the sacrificial life form, with full consent from them. There is no limit to the number of backup life forms this ability can have. The Guardian Angel can also use this on themselves.

Lover's Boon: In conjunction with Sacrificial Pawn, each sacrificed Pawn provides a stackable temporary 5% buff to the Guardian's overall power. This enhancement ceases when the sacrificed Pawn is replaced, by another lifeform, or if they got resurrected.

Domain Of Vigilance: They are now able to conjure an undetectable sphere with a radius spanning 500 meters, enveloping all sides. Within this ethereal domain, they attain heightened perception, becoming acutely aware of their surroundings and capable of reacting to any potentially harmful intent within a mere thousandth of a second. Those who venture into this sanctuary will also experience a gradual sluggishness in their movements, continually decreasing until it reaches a reduction of approximately 25%..

Armor of Absolution: The Guardian Angel can now conjure a full-body armor with aesthetics of the host's choosing. This armor doesn't impede the Guardian's maneuverability in any way, and increases in durability proportionally to the damage incurred, while also boasting swift regeneration capabilities. Additionally, the armor offers complete protection against any harmful psychic or esoteric influences directed at the Guardian Angel, like mind control and internal telekinesis.

Final stand: When all else has failed, your Guardian Angel possesses the ability to merge with you, metamorphosing into an immensely more potent entity that amplifies all their stats by a factor of 1000X. You retain the freedom to determine the overall appearance and aesthetic of this newfound form. However, exercise caution, as this transformation is a last-resort measure, lasting only one hour before a mandatory separation, with a subsequent cooldown period of one week, leaving you the host irreversibly bedridden during that duration.  
*Invincible Guardian*  
Required:Fel Blood (Warcraft)  
The infusion of Mannoroth the Destructor's blood into your Guardian Angel has given rise to an unparalleled protector. They now consistently surpass you in every conceivable way by a factor of 150, with a notable augmentation to their overall passive growth.  
All of their unique abilities have also undergone substantial growth, both in potency and breadth, making them even more formidable, for instance:  
Protector's Wrath will enhance the Guardian Angel's overall stats by a factor of 50, extending the duration to 60 minutes, with a cooldown of 12 hours.  
In the event of their death, the resurrection time has been significantly reduced. They only require a mere 12 hours, instead of the previous 24, to fully revive at their maximum capacity. In the event of the host's demise, for a duration of 24 hours, the Guardian Angel will undergo a remarkable buff of 600% in every conceivable aspect.

Yuki Onna  
Cost: 20 SP  
You belong to an offshoot of an ancient and recluse race, the Yuki Onna. Yuki Onna are a race of yōkai that can instinctively control supernatural snow and ice that cannot be melted by normal mortal fire. You are particularly powerful, able to wield snow on a scale as to freeze a small town on a moment's notice, and so precise and skilled as to recreate an entire village down to the most minute details with no more effort than blinking. As a side effect all your other powers, if you have any, will rise to match the instinctive control and strength of this if possible. You can continue to grow this over time

A traditionally almost entirely female race, your offshoot seems to have resolved this issue through the result of interactions with humans generations ago, resulting in your population not needing to follow the strange practices that the original race had to make sure they survive. As a result of this you’ve been granted incredible control over the development of your offspring, enabling you to choose whatever they inherit from you and any other parent, whether gender, appearance, disposition, or even powers based on genetics. They will all be perfectly healthy and free of any diseases, genetic or otherwise, and unless you wish it otherwise, will be the most perfect version of themselves they can be. As a bonus this also makes you the perfect parent, granting you the supernatural skill and knowledge on how to make every single right decision in raising them and the ability to follow through with it.

If you wish, you may take a small village of 200 of the same race as you to take as free followers. They will all possess the Yuki Onna power, and if you wish, you may also impart on them any other ability you possess that is a result of a race or species. All members of this village, and any children you have as well, will be perfectly loyal.  
Snow Devil  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Yuki Onna  
Your mastery over ice and snow that you wield has transcended the boundaries of the supernatural. This frozen manifestation is now impervious to any form of melting, yielding only to your conscious command. Its inherent hardness has also reached an unparalleled level, presenting a nearly impenetrable defense even against supernatural entities.

Moreover, should your ice come into physical contact with a living being, your Yokai heritage can instantaneously initiate the absorption of their life energy, channeling it back to you. This siphoning process facilitates the healing of almost all forms of injuries within seconds, enhancing your vitality, fortifying your constitution, and contributing to the preservation of a youthful, vigorous appearance, thus prolonging your lifespan.

These enhancements to your powers only applies to you.

Kitsune  
Cost: 20 SP  
You have gained the physiology of a Kitsune, commonly known as a Fox Demon or Fox Spirit. As such, the older you get, the stronger you become, and the more tails you gain, increasing your powers further. You begin with only one tail; this bestows upon you the essential abilities common to all Kitsune. This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to change your form by altering your shape. Foxfire, your Kitsune heritage also grants you access to magic. Your magic can also be used for anything your imagination can come up with, although dark magic is the easiest, as are controlling nature and cursing enemies. including flight. Your Kitsune heritage also grants you power over Illusion, Insanity manipulation, giving and taking mental disorders from people, Life-force absorption, and manipulation, allowing you to give and take life-force and use it for your own ends as well as speeding up the process of gaining new tails, possession, and sleep inducement. You also possess the ability to manipulate the dreams of others. As well as a supernatural intelligence that grows with age.

You start with enough strength to easily destroy a city with your strength and durability to tank an explosion to the face or endure attacks of similar strength to your own. Your Foxfire can burn through anything and will not go out so long as you will it to exist. You need no sleep or food to survive. Your sense of smell is so good that you can smell everything within a city and distinguish between the scents of each individual person, as well as being able to smell when they lie or if they are sick. Your sense of hearing is also on a similar level. You also possess night vision.

Your powers grow the more tails you gain; you gain tails for every 100 years that you live, with the ninth tail taking 1000 years. With each tail, you increase your powers—your powers to twice what they were before—as well as obtain new abilities with each new tail, such as space and time manipulation and reality manipulation once you gain your ninth and final tail. You can optionally be any type of kitsune. Examples include but are not limited to Tengoku, Tricksters, Kukan, Kaze, and many more.  
*Blood of Inari*  
Required:Demigod (Percy Jackson)  
You are either a direct child or legacy of Inari Okami, the Shinto goddess of foxes, fertility, rice, tea, sake, agriculture, industry, and prosperity and good harvest. As one of Inari's Children or Descendants, you have the potential to transcend the typical nine tails of a kitsune and reach a fabled tenth tail, granting you the right to ascend to godhood.  
Inari watches over you closely, far more than the Greek and Roman gods do with their own offspring. Throughout your life as a kitsune, you’ll gain nine tails, and with each tail, you’ll grow in power and mastery. When you finally reach the ninth, only a great deed, quest, or meaningful sacrifice can unlock your tenth tail. Upon this transformation, each of your tails will embody a major domain, while each major domain will branch into secondary and tertiary minor domains.  
As Inari’s child or legacy, your kitsune powers and magic are far stronger than those of others. You will also be able to transform into both a small fox and a giant fox. Because of Japan's early beliefs about Inari, you will have a slight connection to swordsmiths and merchants. Additionally, you’ll gain privileged access to Inari’s Personal Realm of Foxes, a sanctuary for kitsune and Inari’s followers, where you can come and go as you please.  
Your progression to godhood will be quicker than that of most kitsune, earning you each tail at an accelerated rate. Upon reaching the tenth tail, your blood will turn to ichor, the golden blood of the gods, granting you immunity from most mortal needs and protections against common harm. You will gain a profound connection to your domains, bolstering your resilience and bestowing a form of immortality. Free from the divine rules that bind most gods, you’ll also enjoy near immunity to manipulation by time, fate, and destiny—though not complete freedom from their influence. You will become mostly similar to the Gods of Percy Jackson.  
As a Kitsune you have gained the ability to Fast Travel anywhere a Torii Gate resides, even in other worlds.

Cambion  
Cost: 30 SP  
You are a Cambion, specifically a hybrid between that of a human and a demon, making you half-human and half-demon, the half-step between human and demon. You are not bound by the normal weaknesses of either race and still keep a soul that is natural to humans and can no longer be kept at bay via faith, holy water, salt, or any other stereotypical weakness of a demon. Your body has been enhanced so that you could take down a continent with barely any effort, tank hits from a nuclear bomb without a scratch, most weapons made by mortals cannot harm you, and you have virtually infinite stamina. You require no food, water, or oxygen to stay alive. You also have senses stronger than those of the most perceptive animal. You do not age; the only way to die would be through someone killing you.

Your demonic powers are vast and many, including but not limited to: biokinesis, electrokinesis, invisibility, pyrokinesis, thermokinesis, telepathy, mental manipulation, soul reading and manipulation, demonic energy manipulation, teleportation, terrakinesis, voice mimicry, weather manipulation, regeneration, telekinesis, and low-level reality manipulation. However, your abilities are powered by your demonic energy, which is enhanced by your human heritage and soul, allowing you to do anything with demonic energy, including wish-granting so long as it's within your power and making contracts or deals for people's souls. However, it doesn't have to be just souls that you can make deals with; you can take virtually anything so long as the deal is upheld.  
You can be summoned by those trying to summon demons. However, it is your choice if you wish to be summoned or not. You will only get a mental message that someone is trying to summon you.  
The more time that passes, the stronger you get. You feed on the souls and worship of humans, growing your power the more faith or souls you consume, and your own souls react to your demonic energy, acting like a superconductor and supercharging your powers. While you are still alive, you maintain human and Demon forms that are around ten times stronger than your human form. Once you die, you can possess humans until you regain your physical form. Your demon form is a multidimensional form that takes the appearance of your sins and is an energy being in nature when physical. This form can also take the appearance of black smoke when non-physical which allows for the possession of humans.  
*Morningstar*  
Required:Archangel (Supernatural)

Your Demon and Angel forms have combined into an unholy abomination. Angels and Demons are known to cause, specifically in mortals who see them, primordial fear and madness. The inclusion of your demonic inheritance has changed your angelic form to be more eldritch in nature, as your form includes more tentacles and eyes than normal. Instead of causing conflict with the two energies now running through your form, this has instead bolstered them to be further enhanced. If just having a soul and demonic energy made your body a nuclear reactor, then the inclusion of an angel's grace has made your very being a reactor equivalent to the sun in potency. You retain your ability to access both your Angel form and Demon forms. You also gain access to unique forms such as the angel of death Samael, and the serpent that Lucifer took that was described as a dragon.

Let there be light: you have acquired the ability to shape reality in the same way that the universe did. Similar to Samael, when he was still an angel, he created stars and was thenceforth known as the Lightbringer. While you can create virtually anything with this, you find creating holy fire and hellfire to be the easiest things to produce. You were present during the birth of the universe, and the secrets of creation are yours to change and bend to your whim. Concepts and secrets are nothing in your presence.

The root of all evil: You command sin, and with the seven deadly sins, each one grants you a power related to the sin. You are a well of pure corruptive energy, being able to release a mud-like substance that contains the very essence of corruption and all the world's evil, that can change others into evil versions of themselves loyal only to you as the corruptive energy makes them stronger than they were before. However, you don't need to use the mud/corruptive energy, as just being in your presence can corrupt those near you. As well as powering you up further, the more evil that exists in the world, This energy can also be used to create monsters and demons loyal to you; this can be done by corrupting those by moulding their souls or by doing nothing at all.

Additionally, you gain the powers, abilities, and memories of one Lucifer Morningstar, Samael, The Lightbringer, The king of lies, the prince of darkness, and the originator of sin. However, this will not change you as a person. Optionally, this comes with an empty pocket dimension that houses all the souls that you have taken and those who have died that are evil. Should you be killed, you will reform in this pocket dimension, and the only way to truly kill you would be to kill you inside it. This pocket dimension can be shaped to your whims.

Elementalism  
Cost: 30 SP  
You possess an incredibly potent conceptual tie to an element of your choice, this can be something as simple as one of the classical 4 such as Fire, more esoteric versions such as Metal, or even something completely unique such as Life. Your control over your chosen element is unmatched and can be expanded to encompass elements similar in scope such as Earth is to Lava. From the moment you acquire this you have complete control and mastery over your chosen element being able to effortlessly create, summon, dismiss, shape, and control this element on an extraordinary scale such as grand tsunamis and ferocious storms, and with such immense precision that you are not constrained to traditional limitations and are able to just as easily create an intricate dress made of Metal as you would in summoning a tidal wave of Water. You are granted precise control over its every manifestation, from the gentlest breeze to the most intense inferno and are incapable of being harmed by it. But most importantly your ability extends beyond the physical realm. You have the knowledge and ability to use your chosen element conceptually, tapping into their symbolic representation and harnessing its metaphysical properties. You could utilize Fire to inflame passions, ignite creativity, drive others to anger, or use its connection to the sun, heat, and summer to create an everlasting summer.  
*Expanded Domain*  
Required: Avatar (A:TLA), (Breaker) Elemental, or (Shaker) Traveller  
In addition to whatever your chosen element is, you now also have the added elements of the avatar. Your control has now been expanded upon to include Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Energy, Lightning, Combustion, Blood, Ice, Steam, Cloud, Storm, Plants, Lava, Mud, Metal, Sand, Dust, Glass, Crystal, and Spirit and you now possess the ability, with time and effort, to add additional elements to your repertoire. Any elements, concepts, or domains that you possess or can manipulate through any of your powers are also expanded to this power.

Grand Enchant  
Cost: 15 SP  
Anything you can lay your hands on can be permanently strengthened by you by imbuing them with your spirit. You will also gain a refilling pool of spiritual energy to enchant your objects with.  
Regularly infusing your power into the same object will also improve them without limits, though such objects can only be used by you.  
Enchanted objects will be biased towards direct combat-applicable effects, tied towards the base object. All will start with general durability, and physics immunity.  
With time and use, your spiritual pool will grow, and eventually allowing you to forgo earthly needs such as eating, drinking, sleeping, breathing, and excreting waste.

Denial Of Heavens  
Cost: 20 SP  
You deny god's miracles. The power allows you to go against the gods authority by nullifying any power that comes from a divine source. Moreover, this also weakens any gods, divine beasts, priests, divine champion and/or prophets fighting against you. The higher the divinity of your opponent, the weaker they would be. However if the difference in strength between you and your opponent is too large, the debuff will be less.

Eternal Flame  
Cost: 40 SP  
Your Immortal soul burns brightly, like few others, leaving your existence eternal and nearly inviolable. Over time you can recover from anything, even things like true death or reality erasure, reforming at a safe location. You will always return to peak condition in body, mind, and soul. You will not age past your prime, remaining at your peak fitness and attractiveness eternally. These protections are conceptual, allowing you to somehow heal even from things like imprisonment, misfortune or timeline alteration. This power works slowly, but is completely loophole free. You are an Omniversal constant.

This power cannot be lost, stolen, drained, suppressed, copied, or otherwise negatively affected, and it will restore your other powers and abilities just as it restores you.  
*One of a Kind Special*  
Required:Shifting Singularity  
Your powers are one of a kind. They cannot be copied, replicated, mimicked, and so on. This includes protection from even Paragon-level powers and above.  
While it doesn't prevent others from copying people with similar powers to yours, if someone were to somehow successfully obtain a copy of your power, a close enough replica, or even steal it, your powers would instantly become stronger than the copy or replica, and you immediately take the copied/replicated/stolen power from the perpetrator.  
Phoenix  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:Eternal Flame  
You are an Immortal Phoenix, the ideal entity of Life and Death balanced as one. You are able to shift between your human and phoenix form in an instant. Immortality Through Rebirth allows you to return to life, at your peak condition and always stronger than before, you gain an innate resistance to the cause of death, no matter how esoteric it is.

You are made of Fire on a conceptual level, giving you both an immunity to all forms of fire and heat as well as instinctual control over all fire you control, always burning everything you intend to without any mistakes. Your own Phoenix Fire is more than something physical, it is partially conceptual in nature, allowing you to perform feats like burning away old age, or burning away the space between two distances.

Your Phoenix Fire burns itself as a form of fuel, removing any possibility of a simple extinguishment. You are able to restore all entities to their top condition with a mere touch even if you have a bare speck of flesh, regardless of whether they are alive or dead.

This healing touch cures them of any and all ailments, diseases, mental illnesses, curses, and anything that negatively affects their mind, body, and soul. This same level of healing is constantly being applied to you at all times, this can be turned down or even off at will.

Just as you are able to gift life to others, you are able to rip it from them as well. You can cast any entity into the Wheel of Reincarnation upon death, with enough time and practice you will be able to extinguish souls, permanently removing them from the Wheel of Reincarnation.

You passively grow in strength for simply living and with every kill you grow stronger, gaining increased strength for every soul you cast into the Wheel of Reincarnation.

Celestial Brush God (Okami)  
Cost: 35 SP  
You become a Celestial Brush God. This gives you the ability to re-write reality using your divine power and some skill. You can do this by stopping time and writing upon reality what you wish created, changed, or destroyed. You also, as a god, have an innate connection with nature and all things within it will recognize your authority and power, and rightly defer to you. Your power grows the more you help nature and the world, granting you more faith and therefore power. All things can grant faith, but helping humans and other sentients grants the most.  
Mortal weapons and powers can no longer hurt you.  
You can choose an animal form which you can change in and out of at will.  
Note: You use your divine powers in the form of brush techniques, you start out with knowledge and skill with one, but can expand on this by using and experimenting with your powers.  
The Great God (Okami)  
Cost: 35 SP  
Required:Celestial Brush God (Okami)  
You step in the footsteps of Shiranui. You have mastered all the celestial brush techniques and can create more as you please. You now represent, and are, the sun, life, and goodness. Your presence drives off evil and darkness in all its forms with no exceptions. Your presence is like a divine intervention for the world around you, healing and restoring it, filling it with beauty and blessing the land and people.  
Your power is immense, easily enough to govern a solar system, and it will only grow the more faith you have from those around you. If you had the true faith of a medium sized country you could easily affect galaxies.  
Nothing but true evil, and weapons made thereof, can hurt you and even then it's not like you have a weakness to such weapons or abilities, they just affect you normally.  
All things in the world can feel your station, and power when you are near them. Making them naturally feel a deep respect for you. The more sentient a thing is, the lesser this effect is, so humans just feel a sense of respect for you, while animals and plants would treat you like royalty. You can hide your presence, and its effects, if you want to.

Fate Breaker  
Cost: 25 SP  
You. Have. Risen\! Through great internal struggle you have surpassed the chains of fate. The slings and arrows of misfortune no longer find purchase upon your being, leaving your fortunes untarnished and unfettered.

*Luck of the Devil*  
Required:Jade Disciple  
You simply cannot be cut down a peg. No matter what you do you profit from it in some manner. When someone assembles a team to take you down you seemingly become allies instead, when you fall asleep in a meadow you wake up finding that someone lost their treasures right at your feet. And you never seem to get any comeuppance from whatever crazy stunts you pull, seemingly always coming out of it smelling of roses.  
Reader of Stars  
Cost: 15 SP

### Tech and Artifice

The Transgressor  
Cost: 15 SP  
Required: True Genius\!  
You have reached the pinnacle of mastery within each of the Axioms, surpassing the boundaries of possibility. Your creations seamlessly integrated into the fabric of reality without the need for Mania.

Through Apokalypse, the Axiom of Discovery, you can construct sensory platforms that unravel the deepest truths and contradictions of material reality. These platforms unveil the secrets of the cosmos, allowing you to scan all of reality for specific objects and venture into alternate dimensions with ease.

With Epikrato, Axiom of Control, you wield wonders that manipulate crowd density, orchestrate intricate chains of events to shape desired outcomes, and even control wealth and markets. Each wonder showcases your absolute control, from dominating the unaware to conjuring lifelike illusions and programming sleeper agents with precise triggers.

Within Exelixi, the Axiom of Healing, you possess the power to resurrect the dead, mend severe wounds, and sustain life in the most inhospitable environments. Creating immortality elixirs that halt aging and cure any diseases is a trivial task for you.

In the Axiom of Destruction, Katastrof, you craft weapons with devastating capabilities, in your arsenal, vibrating swords that cut molecules, causing anything it cuts to "melt" before the blade, to even bombs that can cause transient black holes and space-time fissures are mere mundane tools.

As a master of Prostasia, the Axiom of Protection, you create impenetrable shields capable of safeguarding against catastrophic strikes. An orbital defense grid you create could withstand an entire planet's nuclear arsenal, without a scratch.

Mastery of Skafoi, the Axiom of Travel, allows you to effortlessly create vehicles capable of traversing space at the speed of light. Furthermore, your comprehension of space-time manipulation allows you to navigate the currents of time itself.

Godcraft  
Cost: 30 SP  
The art of creating a god is something few people know how to do, very often not even when they are actively doing it. You, however, have become adept in the practice.  
Whether it be Gaimanesc ‘belief makes it real’ gods or techno-gnostic godcraft, the divine architecture of creating ‘gods’ (that is to say beings of divine leaning with a domain of influence), is well within your ability.  
The specifics of Godcraft vary depending on the domain and nature of the god being created, not to mention the metaphysics of the universe it’s being created within. That said there is a general series of conditions that need to be fulfilled.

Concept \- You need to establish a concept for the God. These include it’s domains and the very basis of r a ’personality’ to grow from  
Charge \- You need to charge the ‘concept’. Whether this is through raw energy, belief, or some other method will change the nature of the god.  
Manifest \- Finally, you need to Manifest a God. This requires a final blast of the resource used to Charge the God. a Psychic entity for instance may require fifty minds burnt out in order to be fully ‘born’

Attempting to ascend to Godhood using Godcraft is liable to annihilate your soul if even a single aspect is calculated incorrectly. Additionally the cost of doing so is exponentially more difficult than making a God that’s external to you.

Golem Factory (Automata Gigue)  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Magitech  
You can animate inanimate objects by imbuing them with an artificial soul, turning them into golems.

The golem's body determines its strength and capabilities. Simple materials like clay and wood can fashion a basic and clumsy protector, while solid steel and stone would result in an elegant and powerful warrior. The golem's form also dictates its abilities; a bird-shaped automaton can take flight, while a lion-like design is capable of majestic movement on the ground.  
At the heart of every golem lies a precious gemstone core that anchors the soul to the physical form, giving life and purpose to the golem. The choice of gemstone is paramount; a humble river stone may suffice for a simple wooden puppet, but a golem made of advanced magitech requires a gem of the purest diamond.  
However, this power comes with a price. The animating process demands the channeling of lifeforce or inner energy from the wielder. The greater the complexity and material quality, the more energy it requires. For instance, animating a sophisticated magitech golem could result in significant physical exhaustion or long-term fatigue.

Beware, for this power holds both great potential and terrible dangers.

*The Spark of A Soul*  
Required:Aura (RWBY)  
Any golem you create through Automata Gigue are now imbued with their own Aura and Semblance, making them more than mere machines. This greatly enhances their performance in every aspect, from their speed, strength, durability, intelligence, creativity, and even allows your once static creations to naturally grow more powerful over time. Your golems can also use their Aura to protect themselves from harm, recover from any damage they take, and sense their surroundings.  
With Aura, your golems also receive a Semblance that can aid them in their tasks and make them formidable allies or foes. Your golems' Semblances are related to their purpose and design, and can vary from manipulating elements, enhancing physical attributes, creating illusions, or even affecting emotions.  
For example, a lion golem made to protect may gain the Semblance to create ethereal packs of lions that can assist it in combat or scouting, while a mining golem will gain the Semblance to control the earth surrounding it for easier material gathering and tunneling.  
Finally, you can now communicate with your golems telepathically, and command them as you please.  
You are now truly the master of golems.

Treasure Tools Creation  
Cost: 30 SP  
Unlock the wondrous power of "Treasure Tools Creation" a remarkable ability that allows you to manifest extraordinary items infused with incredible powers. These artifacts, known as "Treasure Tools" can take various forms and possess an array of enchantments, limited only by your imagination.

Through this power, you can conjure potent treasures like a blade that burns with magical fire, a ring that enhances your capacity to learn, glasses that grant immunity to mental attacks, or even a storybook that brings its characters to life.

The source of this extraordinary ability lies within an internal reserve, a wellspring of mystical energy that grows and strengthens over time. At its initial stage, your reserve is potent enough to create a single awe-inspiring Treasure Tool—a mighty artifact capable of slicing mountains in half.

As you continue to harness this power and hone your skills, your internal reserve expands, allowing you to craft even more potent and versatile Treasure Tools. The possibilities become endless as you gain greater mastery, and your creations become even more astonishing.

However, crafting a Treasure Tool demands both creativity and energy. Each item you manifest requires a portion of your internal reserve to imbue it with its unique powers. The more intricate and powerful the artifact, the more energy it consumes. Thus, careful consideration and strategy become essential in wielding this power effectively.

Moreover, the Treasure Tools' powers are not set in stone. They can be enhanced and modified through further use of your internal reserve's vast potential. As your understanding of this extraordinary power deepens, you can infuse your creations with even more extraordinary abilities.

Anomaly Infusion  
Cost: 15 SP  
Harness the esoteric forces of the multiverse to imbue ordinary objects with extraordinary powers. With the unique ability of Anomaly Infusion, you can tap into latent energy and channel it into inanimate items, unlocking their true potential.

Enhance weapons, artifacts, and equipment with Anomaly Infusion, granting them exceptional abilities. A simple blade can blaze with celestial fire, a pendant can radiate healing energies, and even a humble tool can manipulate space-time.

Your imagination and understanding of reality's enigmatic forces are the limits. However, there is a daily limit to your infusion capacity, which grows over time as you hone your skills. At first, you can only infuse a couple of objects per day with minor effects. For example, you may infuse a ring that enhances your accuracy, a blade that never dulls, or a gun that shoots bullets capable of passing through cover to hit a target.

As you progress, you will unlock more potent effects and expand the range of objects you can infuse. From artifacts with time-bending properties to weapons that harness elemental forces, the possibilities become increasingly awe-inspiring.

The Celestial Workshop  
Cost: 20 SP  
Within your mind resides the perfect workshop, a realm of limitless creativity where you bring your envisioned designs to life. This celestial sanctuary empowers you with three extraordinary abilities.  
Firstly, your creativity surpasses that of even the greatest artists, granting you unparalleled brilliance. Ideas flow effortlessly as you unlock the depths of your imagination, manifesting awe-inspiring designs.

Secondly, as you conceive your creations, tools and materials materialise within the workshop. These resources are precisely tailored to suit each specific design, providing everything needed for your visions to take form. Whether it's sculptures, inventions, or musical compositions, the workshop offers the perfect means for your endeavours.

Thirdly, the workshop bestows upon you temporary knowledge of magic and advanced scientific principles. Through this knowledge, you can enchant, curse, or bless your creations with mystical properties. Infusing magical energies enhances their capabilities, granting extraordinary qualities. Alternatively, your understanding of futuristic scientific concepts allows you to create technology far beyond modern advancements.

Furthermore, you possess the ability to manifest your conceived items into reality. By channelling a semi-sentient blur of energy, flawless constructs materialize, reflecting the exact details envisioned within the workshop. Weapons forged in this manner possess unlimited ammunition, ready for unleashing their full potential.  
It's important to note that the energy used for manifestation draws upon your stamina. While the possibilities are boundless, the complexity and magnitude of your creations may require rest and recovery to replenish your vitality.  
*Collector of Wonders*  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required: The Celestial Workshop  
As your mastery of the Celestial Workshop deepens, you unlock the extraordinary upgrade known as Collector of Wonders. This enhancement grants you a series of awe-inspiring abilities, further expanding the boundaries of your creative prowess.

The first enhancement empowers you with the gift of Instant Analysis. By merely observing any object or phenomenon, your mind rapidly unravels its inner workings and gains comprehensive understanding. This newfound knowledge is seamlessly transferred to the workshop, allowing you to replicate the analyzed item in its entirety. With this ability, you can effortlessly capture the essence of the extraordinary and instantly gain a perfect replica of it within the Celestial Workshop.

Building upon your crafting abilities, you now possess the power to re-create any item previously brought to life within the workshop. This ability allows you to cheat the constraints of conventional limitations, utilizing lower quality materials without compromising the final result. Furthermore, you gain the proficiency to substitute foreign or exotic materials, allowing you to use their readily available, closest equivalent counterparts. This versatility enables you to unleash your creativity without being hindered by material scarcity.

Delving into the realms of profound mastery, you can now convert your energy constructs into permanent, tangible objects. By imbuing them with immense power and substance, you can bring forth creations that transcend the boundaries of the workshop. However, this magnificent feat comes at a cost, as it expends five times more energy than simply materializing a construct.  
Finally, the upgrade grants you the Right of Ownership over your creations. None of the items you bring to life can be turned against you or used to cause harm. They inherently recognize your authority and prioritize your well-being. Additionally, you gain telekinetic-like control over any item you create, allowing you to manipulate them at will. Through focused energy manipulation, you can move, guide, and manipulate your creations with precision and grace.

Inspired Inventor (Worm CYOA V1)  
Cost: 60 SP  
You are the world's first Tinker-12. Each day you have ten charges, which can be spent to improve your Tinker abilities within a specific specialization or theme. A single charge would make you a good tinker within an area and would be equal to around 4 SP worth of points. Each additional charge put into a power would double your abilities (around an increase of 2 SP per charge), with no limits to how many times you can spend a charge in a certain area or specialization. Spend a couple of charges on augmentation and start crafting cybernetics out of scrap. Spend some on medicine and cure cancer in an hour. Should your different themes overlap, they will stack, building off of each other and integrating perfectly. All technological fields of knowledge such as engineering, chemistry, etc are viable for this.  
*Versatile Genius*  
Cost: 30 SP  
Required:Inspired Inventor (Worm CYOA V1)  
With this upgrade, your Inspired Inventor abilities extend beyond technology, granting you knowledge and skill in any fields of knowledge. By investing charges in various disciplines, you become a universal polymath, surpassing the capabilities of world renowned expert's, and excelling in areas such as martial arts, social engineering, linguistics, philosophy, and more.

Furthermore, the potency of your charge has increase, turning your first charge in a discipline equal to around 5 SP worth of points, and each additional charge after giving an increase by around 3 SP points.

The Craftsman  
Cost: 10 SP  
You are a genius when it comes to crafting. You are instantly skilled with any tool related to a crafting profession and will have at least a foundation in any craft you come across, even if you have never encountered or heard of it before. Furthermore, you have the ability to reverse engineer crafting techniques by simply observing someone using them or by thoroughly examining the finished product. Additionally, given enough time to inspect an item, you can determine how to craft it yourself.  
*Keen Eyed*  
Required:Merchant's Appraisal  
You are no longer limited to the need for close and thorough examination of an object; now, you only need to inspect an item once to learn how to craft it.

The Tinker Toolbox  
Cost: 6 SP  
You now possess the same Striker/Shaker effects all Shard Tinkers have. You are capable of modifying reality to make super tech with common materials. This includes the ability to cut glass with your fingernails, lead to a 95% yield in chemical solutions, using copper as a room temperature superconductor, making plastic from potatoes, and slotting modern components by hand into a board. The only compromise is the need to perform maintenance in all components that defy the laws of physics.

As a bonus, you can enter a fugue-like state for faster build speed and a deeper reality modification, leading to more throughput with the common materials, like making a 3-D printer extrude carbon nano-tubes.

Magitech  
Cost: 10 SP  
You have the remarkable ability to merge magic with technology, creating things that would astound scientists and wizards alike.  
This could be easily combined with any other Tinker power, and is severely hampered without some form of magical ability.  
*Code Caster*  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Magitech  
Delving into the realm of mysticism and the cutting edge, you have unlocked the knowledge to translate magical spells into digital code, allowing them to be uploaded and cast through technological devices. By harnessing the device's inherent power, these spells come to life in extraordinary ways. But the true marvel lies in your ability to manipulate and reshape the very fabric of these spells, for they exist as lines of code waiting to be altered.  
While you are not bestowed with limitless freedom in modifying these spells, you hold the power to shape their mechanics and rules to your advantage. Imagine a shield spell that automatically activates under specific conditions, creating an impenetrable barrier just when you need it most. Picture transforming an elemental spell, shifting its control from the fiery embrace of flames to a gentle inferno, or even changing it's color to pink.  
*Perfect Series*  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Magitech  
Required: Perfect Weapon, Perfect Armor, or Perfect Omnitool  
“Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work.”

Very few have put in the dedication to the craft as you, your very heart and soul going into each creation, regardless of what you make.

You’ve gained the incredible ability to imbue objects you create with the concept of Perfection, allowing you to create things such as the Perfect Vehicle, a vehicle that can travel to any destination in an hour, from wherever regardless of distance, space, or even time.

Or perhaps a Perfect Meal, a meal so nutritious that when eaten will keep a person full for 100 days without any negative side effects, enhance a person’s natural abilities 10 fold, not to mention so splendid that people would find themselves crying tears of joy upon tasting to it.

You can choose to imbue the concept into anything and everything you craft. All your abilities related to crafting, technology, or creation in general all get a significant boost. You also now find great joy in the process of creation, and are much more creative in general.

*Forged in the Soul*  
Required:Inner Beast  
“The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul.”

It’s not just the concept of Perfection that you know how to work with, but of Soul as well. Over time this will also grow to include other concepts.

You’re now capable of reaching into the very souls of another, capable of utilizing a piece of something’s soul in the creation of things. The piece of their souls will immediately regenerate itself to the one it's taken from, unless you will it otherwise, however this grants an immense array of possibilities.

The first, is the ability to imbue objects you’ve created with properties of their original soul source. From powers to knowledge, anything can be imbued with anything.

The second ability, and perhaps most important, is that you can now forge items intended for someone, greatly improving and increasing the power it would give them. Almost as if made exactly for them, bound in a way nothing else could.

The third and final ability is you’ve also now gained the ability to forge Inner Beasts yourself, capable of directly forging them out of the souls of others or yourself.

### Esoteric and Abstract 

Voidwalker  
Cost: 30 SP  
You have been unmade and reborn through the Void, transformed into that which resides outside, a Voidwalker. While you can manifest in contemporary reality, you are most at home in the Void, the infinite nothingness which exists outside of and in between all realities, connecting everywhere and everywhen all at once.

Your nature as something born from the Void allows you to easily move in, enter, and exit it, slipping between the boundary of reality and the Void in an instant. This, coupled with the ease at which you can traverse the Void allows you to easily bypass all sorts of traps and defenses, for only things designed to stop those from Outside are capable of hindering you. You can even use the Void to spy, simply sitting on the edge of the boundary and observing anywhere within a world. Additionally, you possess an intuitive sense of direction in the Void, never losing track of where you are or where you’ve been.

Due to its nature as the connector of when and where, the Void lacks a proper concept of space and time. Everything exists simultaneously right up against each other and infinitely far away. Of course this does mean that movement in the Void is effectively infinitely fast, as distance becomes irrelevant. Furthermore, time isn’t consistent either, you could spend eons in the Void and come out to find only a few days have passed, with the inconsistency usually \- but not always \- resulting in more time taking place in the Void then in reality. A way to get around the Void’s temporal inconsistency is to stick close to a world, merely skimming the surface of the Void and essentially anchoring your time to that of the World.

However, this same nature provides an opportunity. While at first you are limited to choosing where you exit the Void, with time and experience you can choose when you exit as well, arriving at your destination in the same moment you left, seemingly teleporting. With enough experience you can appear wherever and whenever you desire, seemingly capable of existing in multiple places at the same time due to your non-linear time stream.

Lastly, your nature as a being made from the Void has caused you to interact weirdly with the temporal axis, owing the Void’s atemporal nature. You are completely ageless, for you are no longer flesh and blood, but Void masquerading as such. You possess near absolute immunity to temporal manipulation and paradoxes, with attempts to alter your past and/or future failing, as do time stops, timeline changes, and basically any form of temporal affect you don’t initiate yourself. Furthermore, due to being Void pretending at flesh, your survivability and pain tolerance are much greater. You aren’t more durable per se, it’s just that you don’t bleed and can ignore wounds unless they actually damage the functionality of your body. As a side note, being in the Void heals you on a physical and spiritual level.

Rock Star  
Cost: 25 SP  
You are a Rock Star\! Through the power of songs and Rock 'n' Roll, you can bend reality to your whims\! Sing a song about victory, and victory shall befall you, sing "The Hardest Button to Button" and see multiple drums following you everywhere.  
Sing about world peace, and you shall see countless followers around you protesting, flourishing, and promoting world peace wherever they go\!  
Your songs touch a higher realm and therefore can even affect those who are otherwise supposed to be untouchable and unreachable.  
You have a tremendous talent with every musical instrument and every type of music. Every time you want to create a new song or are about to sing, you will feel inspiration fill your entire being, and your charisma will grow by leaps and bounds\!  
Your true vocal cords are ethereal, so your voice can never be muted, and your songs shall never be interrupted.  
Every song you make will be glamorous and infatuate anyone who hears it, and they can even touch the soul of those who hear your songs\!  
However, you have one weakness: your voice can't reach farther than you are already capable of, but you could use other means to make your voice reach places beyond your capability.  
With enough practice, you will always be the best when it comes to music.

Killing Intent  
Cost: 5 SP  
You have the power to, at will, exude a terrifying aura, which channels your own ill feelings and hate and imposes it on people around you.  
The scale of its effects depends on how strong you are relative to the people exposed to it, as well as their willpower. It can vary from them getting a chill running down their spines, wetting themselves or losing control of their bowels, passing out in terror, and in some extreme cases, can even kill them with a heart attack.  
*Inherited Fear*  
Required:Heir to the Throne  
Required:Inheritance  
Skills are not the only things that can be transmitted; so can fear. Those whom you attempt to kill will carry that fear deep within their hearts, and it will resurface every time you are near.  
This fear can be reignited if someone you train or your own descendants bear any resemblance to you. Similarly, the terror inspired by those who came before you may manifest through you, serving as a grim reminder of those who met their end at the hands of your ancestors.  
Ancestral fear is a force not to be taken lightly.  
*Scarousal*  
Required:Reputable  
You can now precisely control to what degree your aura affects targets as well as cause specific physiological reactions in response to your aura. From trembling knees to passing out or a heart attack, the result will be exactly what you desire, as long as your fear aura could cause such an effect in the first place.  
Additionally, you can now induce a secondary emotion. While it will be felt weaker than fear, the strength of it will be proportional to the terror your target experiences. This secondary emotion might be anything you desire, from despair and hatred to awe, reverence, or anything else, and will color the memories and perception others have of you after the fight.

Inducing despair, for example may cause your opponents to come to conclusion that fighting you is another form of suicide, never mustering courage to try again, while admiration may even cause them to rethink their loyalties and switch sides.  
Sea of Blood  
Cost: 3 SP  
Required:Killing Intent  
Your Killing Intent can now grow both through the number of lives you take and by the weight of their despair. Killing those with strong willpower or deep emotions exponentially strengthens your aura. The residual fear of your past victims lingers within it, creating a phantom dread that affects even those unaware of your presence.  
This Killing Intent gains the power to cause illusions to those exposed to it, allowing targets to feel physical sensations of imagined deaths, such as the searing pain of fire, the suffocation of drowning, or the agony of being torn apart.  
In areas stained with violence and death, such as battlefields or massacre sites, your power intensifies dramatically. The ambient malice of the location amplifies your Killing Intent, making it increasingly difficult to resist, overwhelming even those with immense willpower.  
While powerful, it is still limited by how strong you are relative to the people exposed to it, as well as their willpower.  
*Embodiment of Murder*  
Required:Menticide (I'm Sorry For Being Born In This World)  
To you who has their mental framework of your mind altered, killing is not a habit or instinct for you; it is the essence of your existence, infused into every thought, every action, and every breath you take. This singular fixation grants your Killing Intent a terrifying potency. When you fixate on killing a specific individual, your desire alone can exponentially increase the strength of your Killing Intent against them, piercing through even the strongest defenses and willpower with chilling precision. This fixation sharpens your intent like a blade, making it almost impossible to ignore or resist.

Any joy you derive from killing further amplifies your Killing Intent. The euphoria of taking life feeds into your aura, making it grow darker, heavier, and more oppressive. This feedback loop between your enjoyment and your intent turns every kill into a step toward deeper, more devastating power. As killing is inseparable from your very being, your Killing Intent is ever-present, even when reduced to its barest form. This constant state manifests as a subtle yet unnerving aura—a "scent of blood" that clings to you, causing unease and discomfort to all who encounter you. Even in moments of calm or concealment, this aura marks you as a predator and sets you apart from all others.  
Your mere presence can distort the mental stability of those around you, as the ever-present stain of your murderous nature seeps into their consciousness. People may feel inexplicable fear, dread, or paranoia, even without understanding why. This constant aura has the potential to erode the resolve of enemies over time, making them more susceptible to the full force of your Killing Intent when you choose to unleash it. The sheer inevitability of death that radiates from you renders you a walking nightmare, embodying the concept of murder itself.  
If you have Scarousal, you can precisely control this constant aura, even separate the effects to make sure allies do not suffer from it.  
*Harbinger of Death*  
Required:Clarity (Shadow Slave)  
Through your Clarity, you have fully Self-Actualised your Killing Intent, transforming it into a precise and adaptable extension of your will. When entering Clarity, your Killing Intent is no longer a passive force—it becomes a weapon, a shield, and a tool, seamlessly integrated into every action and thought. You can channel and focus your Killing Intent with superhuman precision, empowering both yourself and the objects you wield.  
While in Clarity, your Killing Intent sharpens your purpose to its absolute edge. You can imbue weapons with your intent, making blades impossibly sharp, projectiles faster and more accurate, and even mundane objects like stones or shards of glass deadly instruments of destruction. These empowered objects carry the weight of your Killing Intent, striking with enhanced power and instilling a primal fear in your enemies.  
When focused inward, your Killing Intent enhances your physical and mental capabilities to extraordinary levels. Your movements become impossibly fluid and efficient, every step and strike calculated with surgical precision to ensure victory. The aura of your Killing Intent cloaks you, warping perceptions and making you appear more monstrous and unstoppable in the eyes of your enemies. You can even use it to improve the strength of any powers you may have. This constant aura of bloodlust disrupts your opponent’s focus and weakens their resolve, amplifying your combat dominance.

Beyond offense, you can Self-Actualise your Killing Intent defensively. By projecting it outward, you create an oppressive barrier of malice that slows or deflects incoming attacks. Enemies feel as though they are striking against an impenetrable wall of focus and purpose, further eroding their confidence and effectiveness.  
*Bodhisattva of the Circular Path*  
Required:Lotus Sutra  
Required:Clarity (Shadow Slave)  
You transcend the limitations of mortal perception and action, ascending to a state of existence that bridges enlightenment and violence. You are a Bodhisattva of the Circular Path, embodying the perfect harmony between purpose and destruction.  
You are constantly in the state of Clarity, creating a meditative equilibrium that heightens your abilities in combat and beyond. Your mind operates at a transcendent level of focus and awareness, viewing violence not as chaos but as an eternal cycle of creation and destruction.  
As a Bodhisattva of violence, your Killing Intent evolves into a force of enlightenment. When channeled, it becomes a manifestation of the dharma of murder, impartial and absolute, weighing down on your foes as if the universe itself has turned its gaze upon them. This enlightened Killing Intent allows you to pierce through all forms of deception, resistance, or distraction, focusing solely on the singular purpose of parting souls from bodies.

Techniques, spells, mantras, and even mundane skills are now reflections of the eternal cycle, reshaped into tools of perfection. You can craft techniques that embody the principles of the Circular Path—martial styles that flow endlessly, unbreakable as a wheel, and devastating as its crushing force. Your ability to assimilate new skills or master existing ones reaches its zenith, allowing you to rival or surpass masters of any art in mere hours.  
Your understanding of violence as a universal truth allows you to find clarity in all things, effortlessly applying your insight to the mundane and extraordinary alike. The Gates of Determinism are enhanced by your meditative mastery. While in combat or meditation, you can now observe the circular patterns of violence in both your opponent’s actions and your own. This grants you a deeper form of pseudo-precognition, allowing you to anticipate actions not only based on known information but also by perceiving the “flow” of violence in the moment.  
By chanting the Lotus Sutra, you can invoke its power, cleansing your mind of all adverse effects, rejuvenating your fighting spirit, and fortifying your willpower with each recitation. Beyond its restorative properties, the chant serves as a meditative anchor, expanding your insight and allowing you to perceive hidden truths and uncover opportunities that may have been obscured. With each repetition, your connection to the eternal cycle deepens, sharpening your focus and strengthening your resolve, whether in the heat of combat or moments of contemplation.  
As the Bodhisattva of the Circular Path, you are the wheel-smashing lord of the dharma of murder. Your existence is a paradox of calm and destruction, embodying the perfect understanding of violence as both the cycle and the purpose of life.

The Sanctioned Action (K6BD)  
Cost: 35 SP  
...is to cut. There is only one, maybe two people in the entire Multiverse that have the skill to cut. And it is much more than just cutting something with a sword. To Cut means division by the blade of Want, that parer of potentials that excises infinities. And by cutting, you cut not only the physical, but the universe itself. At the point where you start at, it is “merely” the ability to cut through anything not completely invincible. But by studying and growing the act of cutting, you will grow in Strength.  
At the end of the road for this, you will be able to cut anything, no matter how strong or durable or esoteric or abstract it is. Not only that, but you can cut people without so much as drawing your sword, and cut things just by touching them. You can also project a “laser” from the tip of your sword, and it cuts as well as you can.

Sword of Damocles  
Cost: 20 SP  
The Sword of Damocles is a formidable and versatile weapon that exists as a pool of energy within you, serving as both an offensive and defensive force. This mystical sword can take on any appearance of your choosing and possesses unique properties that set it apart from conventional weapons.  
In its dormant state, the Sword of Damocles resides within you as a concentrated pool of energy, ready to be called upon when needed. When summoned into existence, the sword hovers above your target, guided by an unerring tracking ability. This allows it to pursue and engage your designated target with relentless precision. It bypasses all defenses and immunities, ensuring that no obstacle can shield your chosen adversary from its wrath.  
As you continue to employ the Sword of Damocles, its capabilities expand and evolve. Each successful takedown of a target enhances the sword's overall power and grants you greater control over its destructive potential. By eliminating multiple targets of the same type—whether they be humans, goblins, elves, houses, or even cities—the Sword accumulates damage multipliers specific to those targets. This means that future strikes against the same type of target will unleash even more devastating damage.  
Furthermore, the Sword of Damocles possesses the ability to split into multiple swords, granting you unprecedented flexibility and tactical advantage. You can distribute the strength of the sword in any combination you desire, tailoring your attack strategy to suit the situation at hand. Whether you choose to wield a single sword at maximum power or divide it into multiple blades with varying degrees of strength, the decision is yours to make. For example, you can split the sword into two blades, with one carrying 25% of the total strength and the other wielding 75%. Alternatively, you can opt for a multitude of smaller swords, each contributing a fraction of the total damage output.

Perfect Host  
Cost: 25 SP  
Forces outside of your control are attracted to you like a moth to a flame. Biological creatures see you as their perfect body, cosmic forces pursue you as if you were their soulmate, magical artifacts feel as if you were their destined user, and if you injected yourself with power-granting serums, they would fit you like custom-made clothing; even if they had side effects, you would be immune to them. Strong enough forces can resist you and even retaliate if you go after them, but eventually, your powers could grow so much that even beings like Marvel's Phoenix Force would look at you as if you were the second coming of Jean Grey, even if you don't have psychic powers.  
You can access 100% of the powers your currently hosted entities possess, and you start by being able to host at most three entities within your being. You also possess a pocket dimension where you can store those you are currently unable to use, and you must abide by the contract of every being that decides to be with you. However, you can reject them unless they require nothing.  
Additionally, you have the ability to outright negate any influence an entity you do not wish to host has over you, so if they're unsatisfied that you don't want them and try to persuade you with their powers, they can't. Furthermore, this grants you esoteric protection against the powers of those entities, shielding you from the influence of eldritch beings or even gods with a ridiculous amount of charisma, such as the gods and goddesses of love.  
As time goes on, you will eventually be able to host more and more entities simultaneously until you can have an unlimited number of them at the same time.

True Dragon (Tensura)  
Cost: 60 SP  
True Dragons are the highest ranking beings in existence. They're nigh-invulnerable and nigh-unstoppable avatars of nature that serve as the pillars of all creation. You are free to choose where you sit as an avatar of nature, whether that's an aspect of your own creation or one that is similar to the other True Dragons.  
True Dragons, as spiritual life-forms, do not have a set singular appearance or form and can assume the appearance and properties of whatever they wish, with no real attachment to their bodies. As spiritual beings, whatever form they assume will be affected by their own personal self-image and individuality. True Dragons typically have a more traditional draconic form, in addition to a secondary human-like form. Their large draconic form is capable of taking and dealing much more damage, while their human form is far more energy efficient and is better suited for long-term battles.

Once born, a True Dragon may never be truly killed. Even if their body is killed, they will be born again elsewhere with the same natural characteristics and memories. The process of rebirth may result in loss or change of some aspects of their personality, yet they will understand the nature of their new existence immediately after birth.  
If left unchecked, the magicules from your aura will eventually permeate into your surroundings, mutating organic and inorganic matter to give rise to monsters or other magicule-based lifeforms, and magicule rich ores and other materials.  
True Dragons have three intrinsic skills their kind shares, otherwise they are unique.

Dragon Spirit Haki: Powerful Haki that imbues the user's aura with magical and physical properties, shredding anything it comes into contact with.  
Universal Sense: Allows the user to perceive almost all sensations including but not limited to, light, sound, smell, and heat in a wide radius.  
Universal Shapeshift: Allows the user to freely change their body's properties and disguise their appearance.

Upon your first incarnation, you will develop a Unique Skill that synchronizes and synergizes with your aspect of nature, allowing you to fully realize your command over the natural world. With enough effort and introspection, you will be able to evolve your Unique Skill into an appropriately related Ultimate Skill that will take your command over your natural aspect even further. Your Ultimate Skill will be potent enough to potentially contain a World System Subskill, giving you the ability to create a unique world related in some way to your aspect.

Ultimate Skill Hecate: Lord of Magic  
Cost: 30 SP  
Required:Voice of the World (Tensura)  
An ultimate skill corresponding to the user’s fundamental desires to rule over the practice and manipulation of magic. Like any ultimate skill, this grants the ability to control some of the laws of nature. The only counter is another ultimate skill wielder. Such is the absolute, undeniable rule of the world. Ownership of this skill confers the following abilities:

Cardinal Bond: establishes a soul corridor between the user’s soul and with the Cardinal World, itself. This grants the user a near-limitless reserve of magicules to call upon to supply their magic. The breadth of this soul corridor has empowered it to the point that the user will find themselves always connected to the Cardinal World, no matter which universe or dimension they find themselves in. Thus, the user can easily use magic wherever they please, regardless if there are anti-magic barriers or other phenomena in effect.  
Magic Manipulation: allows the user to directly interfere with someone else’s magic in a manner that is much more controlled and efficient than relying on a large-scale barrier.  
Law Domination: Allows for complete and total control of magic to such a degree that the user’s command of magic goes beyond the need for using mere spells to command the World. The user’s magic, alone, is enough to compete and possibly supersede the effects of another’s ultimate skill, something otherwise unheard of.

Ultimate Skill Belzebuth: Lord of Gluttony (Tensura)  
Cost: 30 SP  
Required:Voice of the World (Tensura)  
One of the Seven Deadly Sins series of ultimate skills, corresponding to a person's fundamental desires. Though born as imitations of the capabilities of the Angelic System of ultimate skills, these skills still boast just as much potency. Like any ultimate skill, this grants the ability to control some of the laws of nature. The only counter is another ultimate skill wielder. Such is the absolute, undeniable rule of the world. Ownership of this skill confers the following abilities:

Predation: Can absorb matter, skills, or magic into the body. Conscious beings can attempt to resist being absorbed. It can be used at range and can even affect space itself.  
Imaginary Space: An infinite space where absorbed targets can be stored, including otherwise harmful materials or things needing to be analyzed. Replicated items can be stored here upon production. This space is unaffected by time. Anything in this space can be broken down to replenish the wielder's magicule reserves.  
Mimicry: Allows for replication of anything that has been absorbed and sufficiently analyzed, including appearance, skills and abilities, and relative information about the target.  
Corrosion: This works in conjunction with Predation to decompose an absorbed target into pure magicules. This increases the likelihood of absorbing an ability of a target with only partial absorption, even if that is lower than after full absorption.  
Soul Consumption: This allows for reaping the souls of those who have lost their will to live and fight against the wielder. Even if the target leaves the presence of the wielder, once the condition has been met their souls can be reaped at any point, even if they later recover their will to live.  
Food Chain: This allows for a greater connection to those the wielder has a soul connection with. The wielder can freely copy prototypes of the skills of those subordinate to them or grant them other skills the wielder possesses. The wielder's reserves of magicules will also grow as their subordinates exhibit any significant growth.

This isn't even my final form  
Cost: 25 SP  
You now have the ability to take on a series of immensely powerful transformed states of your own design, with the first one giving a 10x boost to all your powers and physical stats, and the others after that offering a 10x boost to the previous form. These transformations could take a myriad of themes and appearances that follow them, maybe you want to look more animalistic or more regal, have a more monstrous theme etc, you can choose and design each form provided it follows your transformation's theme.  
Note, that each form drains stamina and the stronger the form is the more stamina it drains and if not careful, could kill you, this can be mitigated through training.  
You start with your first form and can unlock more in the future through training or a sudden boost of extreme emotion such as rage

Alibi Block (Medaka Box)  
Cost: 60 SP  
This is the ability that allows Najimi Ajimu to instantaneously appear wherever and whenever she wants, including physical locations such as: in a locked room, in space, in heaven, or in hell, as well as metaphysical places such as: inside a dream, inside a heart, or even inside people. There is no place in all of reality that is beyond your grasp.

The Black Swan (The Record Of A Fallen Vampire)  
Cost: 55 SP  
The Black Swan is a curse that was created by the legendary Saberhagen, and has been cursing generations of humans all for the sake of killing the vampire king. You receive a copy of this curse, although it is slightly changed from the original one, as it offers only benefits and takes away any of the drawbacks. Some of the most notable changes that you receive are a significant boost to your physical capabilities, along with the ability to fly. While you might not yet have the strength to match a vampire blow for blow, you effortlessly surpass the vampire queen and king in speed. Keep in mind that when those two go all out, they are easily able to move at significant relativistic speeds, so this boost isn't meant to be taken lightly. The greatest ability of the black swan is its ability to nullify any magic it comes in contact with. Any magic that comes within an inch of any part of your body will be nullified, unlike the original which only had the arms. You’re able to form a solid anti-magic barrier around yourself and others in case you have to protect people from magic spammers. This nullification is selective so any magic you want to be affected by will work along with your own.  
The final ability of the black swan is its ability to grow in power with every generation. With each passing year you grow stronger, surpassing the past version of yourself as any limits you have are broken. Given enough time all of your abilities, powers, and everything else about you will be boosted in strength the longer you exist. Even when doing absolutely nothing you’ll find that you surpass the previous year’s version of yourself by quite a margin. If you were to train any of your skills they would gain an astronomical boost as any gains will be heavily accelerated due to your time limiter being removed. There is no limit to this either, so given a year or a short workout you’ll surpass the vampire king in strength, and will go even further beyond. While you may not be unstoppable now, time is all you need before you surpass everyone.

Mundane Acts  
Cost: 5 SP  
You gain a shroud that distorts mortal perception, concealing any supernatural abilities or effects on you from non-supernatural humans. Ordinary people will perceive ordinary, mundane explanations instead of supernatural realities. For example, they might see a monster as a large dog or a magic battle as a minor street fight. This shroud maintains the separation between the mortal world and the supernatural, ensuring most humans remain unaware of the true nature of their surroundings. With time and practice, it is possible to extend this shroud to others, cloaking a magical castle or hiding the monstrous form of others.  
While this ability primarily targets non-supernatural humans, it can also partially affect individuals with supernatural abilities, though they may be able to see through the shroud depending on their own powers and talents. This shroud is especially effective at hiding knowledge that the ordinary mind cannot handle, often completely erasing such information from their memory.  
*Everyday Occurrence*  
Required:Plausible Deniability  
Your mastery over the manifestation of your powers has significantly advanced. You can now dictate precisely how others perceive the supernatural phenomena you conjure. This refined control not only enhances your versatility but also extends to your capability to envelop others within this veil of illusion. Whether it's concealing an entire enchanted castle or disguising the true, terrifying forms of other beings, your improved proficiency allows you to wield this power with ease and precision.  
Your enhanced powers now ensure that your shroud is completely impenetrable. People have no chance of seeing through them, regardless of their natural perception abilities or magical talents designed to pierce such veils. Even those with specialized powers meant to detect or unravel illusions will find themselves utterly deceived and unable to discern the true nature of your supernatural acts.

Perfectly Hidden  
Cost: 25 SP  
You can now use an advanced form of invisibility, becoming completely undetectable by sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste, as well as any powers, senses, and detections of supernatural, preternatural, paranormal, and or, technological nature.  
Your presence and entire being is hidden to the point where others would always overlook you without being consciously and or unconsciously aware of it.  
This power can extend onto any inanimate objects through physical contact, if you want it to, but any carbon based lifeforms other than yourself wont be affected. Effects of this power are immutable, and wont ever stop unless you want them to, whether choosing to stop it selectively on a particular subject or stopping it entirely.  
Take care though, because if you died while this power was still active, your body, and or object(s) you had applied this power on, would forever stay undiscovered.

Deadly Mirror  
Cost: 20 SP  
You possess the ability to traverse into an alternate dimension accessed through mirrors. This dimension mirrors the real world you currently inhabit but stands devoid of any inhabitants except yourself. Time holds no sway in this realm, ensuring that you remain unaffected by the passage of time while within it. Any mirror in your world serves as a portal to enter and exit this dimension.  
This reflective world is intricately connected to the real one. Every action you undertake in this mirrored dimension has a corresponding effect in the real world, should you choose it to be so.  
Your control over this dimension allows you to manipulate not only inanimate objects but also the bodies of living beings reflected within it. You can commandeer the reflection of a car, steering it without physically occupying the driver's seat, or manipulate a rock and propel it in any chosen direction. The only constraint to this ability is that the subject must be reflected in a mirror first before you can assume control. Additionally, if the mirror through which you establish control is destroyed, your influence over the subject will be severed.

Master of the Trapezohedron's  
Cost: 45 SP  
Rejoice\! You have been chosen and blessed by The Shining Trapezohedron. Through a twisted connection with your shadow, you have become the Warden of a prison that holds a nightmarish horde of creatures that sing with the discordant tunes of madness. Your very being serves as a gateway to a prison realm located beyond space and time, where unspeakable horrors from beyond eagerly await your commands to cast their shadow in the world once more.  
As the Warden of eldritch horrors, you command the ability to summon and temporarily release these otherworldly beings. From the depths of your shadow, they emerge, tendrils of darkness intertwining with their grotesque forms. Their presence instills fear and despair in all who witness their existence. Once they have completed their objectives, they are drawn back into your shadow, for they can never be truly free unless you allow it. At the start you will only be able to summon weaker creatures, such as Night-Gaunts, and Deep Ones, but in time you will be able to call upon the might of even gods.  
Within the prison realm, you possess absolute control, shaping it according to your will. It is through your shadow, a gateway to this twisted realm, that you can seal the fates of others. With a mere touch, you can push individuals into the prison, subjecting them to the horrors that lurk within.

Inside the prison realm, your accelerated healing abilities ensure swift recovery from any wounds, while simultaneously halting the aging process of your body. Additionally, you hold dominion over time, granting you the power to choose whether it flows normally or becomes frozen in the outside world.  
Furthermore, you have attained immunity to the sanity-damaging effects inflicted by eldritch forces. Their mind-shattering influence has no hold over you, leaving you unaffected by their torment.  
*Shackles of Subjugation*  
Required:Fictitious Dreams of The Kings of Feys  
Your eldritch patron has metamorphosed into the binding chain that tethers other eldritch creatures, enabling the summoning of higher-level entities under its dominion. These creatures, restrained by your patron's power, heed your call and serve your will. Their already formidable abilities bolstered by your patron's, extending your dominion over the eldritch forces. With these Chains, your patron becomes an instrument of control, granting access to more potent beings and solidifying your influence over the prison realm. Balance power and command as you navigate this newfound dominion.

Fictitious Dreams of The Kings of Feys  
Cost: 30 SP  
Within the depths of your own shadow resides an enigmatic and ancient entity—an eldritch presence that becomes your patron, bestowing fragments of its immense power while cautioning against the overwhelming influence of eldritch energies that your mortal form cannot fully endure.  
As the eldritch patron manifests its powers through your shades, your own shadow becomes a conduit, pulsating with interwoven eldritch energies, the sound of skittering madness, and the otherworldly fractal of unreality.

Being an outsider to reality, your patron possesses mastery over the manipulation of reality itself. Probability bends to its command, allowing it to shape and influence events within the boundaries of possibility. This power echoes the enigmatic nature of Marble Phantasms, enabling the manifestation of phenomena that surpass conventional understanding.

Gifted with clairvoyance, your eldritch patron enhances your perception and grants you glimpses into the threads of fate. You become attuned to hidden truths and potential outcomes, surpassing the limitations of mortal senses.

Embracing your patron's essence, you become a conduit of both incredible potential and great vulnerability. Your mortal body struggles to contain the overwhelming influx of eldritch energy.  
The eldritch patron's ultimate power, Chaoskampf, stands as a testament to its dominion over the blurred boundaries of reality. With this power, your patron fully emerges from your shadow and destabilises the superstructure of the cosmos, expanding the divide between truth and falsehood, fact and fiction. Allowing your patron to denote and redefine what can and cannot be.  
Additionally, you can choose the background of your relationship with your patron. E.g perhaps the patron may have fallen in love with you, hence why it has chosen to become your patron.  
*Eternal Union*  
Required:Eternal Flame  
Through profound communion, your bond with the eldritch patron becomes eternal, granting easier access to immense power and seamless manifestations. The essence of your souls intertwine, forging an unbreakable connection, impervious to hindrance.  
The flowing of eldritch energies become fluid, empowering actions and augmenting all your abilities effortlessly. Your patrons manifestations require less strain, revealing heightened clarity and interaction. The strengthened bond ensures eternal attachment, safeguarding against all severance or negativity. This unbreakable link ensures perpetual support, drawing upon the patron's power and guidance without fear of loss

Words of Power  
Cost: 25 SP  
You have a way with words. Maybe you can shout in the ancient tongue of dragons (“FUS RO DAH\!”), work magic through rhymes, are fluent in the original language of man or just speak so forcefully the world has to listen. Whatever the source, you can change reality just by spelling. In general, the more words, the larger or more complicated the effect, though don’t expect your enemies to sit back while you rattle off a soliloquy to finish them off. This ability starts off moderately and gets stronger gradually, allowing you to accomplish more with fewer words.

The Dealmaker  
Cost: 30 SP  
You possess the ability to deal with people, granting them supernatural powers and abilities in exchange for something. It can be as low as a simple rock or as high as complete and utter obedience to yourself.  
You can grant someone a superpower, unlock the potential hidden within their minds, or allow them to channel magic. Your physical, mental, and spiritual strength determines how many deals you can make and how strong the abilities you grant can be. An average human could make one deal per week before they have to rest for the remainder of the week, and the power it would grant would be limited to the equivalent of 5 SP. A human with Olympic potential could make one deal per three days, and it would be limited to 10 SP and so on.  
(The power you grant can either be permanent or, if you make it clear in the deal, be temporary, lasting from days to months to even years if you wish for it.)  
*The Gift Giver*  
Cost: 20 SP  
Required:The Dealmaker  
You are no longer required to make a deal to give powers, and you are now capable of giving yourself powers, though it will be half as effective as giving others powers. You are also no longer limited here to just giving. One power at a time, and the strength of the powers you give is no longer connected to your physical, mental, and spiritual strength; rather, in the beginning, you are given 10 SP worth of power and guaranteed a growth of 1 SP per month for the first 50 months; after that, any growth must be achieved through training and pushing your power to its limits repeatedly.  
You are not limited in the number of powers you can give, but you cannot give conflicting powers unless you're willing to risk either the death of the subject or the total and permanent loss of power of the one you're giving powers to. You also possess the capability of imbuing objects with powers, though in the beginning it is limited to one per object, and after 50 months you will be able to imbuing objects with three powers.  
You are capable of upgrading powers that you have given, but they must follow the path of evolution for that power, and you cannot create a power by upgrading a pre-existing power, nor can you upgrade a power beyond the amount of SP you currently have.  
For powers that require knowledge, you will automatically create the knowledge and give it to the individuals alongside their power, and you can make it so that the powers you give can grow in strength with training and experimentation at the cost of them being slightly weaker in the beginning.  
(You're able to choose whether Giftgiver can create powers that affect itself; if so, the powers will cost at least 60 SP and require a larger amount of concentration and focus to create, or whether Giftgiver is incapable of creating powers that affect itself.)

Memetic Sensitivity  
Cost: 17 SP  
You possess a continuous awareness of all entities that hold information about you. You can perceive their presence, whether they be written records, individuals, or even organizations. This awareness acts as a radar, alerting you to their existence and allowing you to discern the depth and nature of the information they hold about you.  
Additionally, you gain insight into any and all entities proportional to the volume and specificity of the information they possess about you. The more extensive and detailed their knowledge, the greater your awareness of them grows.

Golden One  
Cost: 10 SP  
You can create and manipulate any kind of money, currency and wealth, be it notes, coins, gold, jewels and anything that is currently used as currency (even digital currencies like bitcoin). However, this power does not work on goods used for barter. With this power you will never be poor. Do try not to crash the world economy.

Dolos (Bleach)  
Cost: 25 SP  
You now possess the ability to skillfully manifest nigh flawless illusions. Your mastery over the faculties that shape one's perception of reality is unparalleled, enabling you to induce a state of near complete hypnosis in anyone subject to your manipulation. You can project diverse shapes and forms, manipulate the perception of time in those within your vicinity, or envelop them in profound darkness by impeding their senses. With sufficient expertise, you can even construct an entire lifetime for them within a matter of seconds. The potential applications of these powers are limited only by the boundaries of your imagination.  
While the illusions you create wield significant potency, individuals of considerable power and proficiency themselves may discern subtle disparities between the illusions and reality, although they may struggle to pinpoint the exact nature of these discrepancies. The definitive means to wholly dispel these illusions is either through physical contact with you by those ensnared within them, or through your death.

Divine Protection (Re:Zero)  
Cost: 40 SP  
The possessor of this extraordinary ability has the power to acquire any Divine Protection they desire in specific situations and retain them permanently. These Divine Protections are granted by an entity known as Od Laguna (The World), which can even create new Divine Protections that have never existed before. However, there is a chance of miscommunication, leading to the recipient not receiving the intended Divine Protection accurately. This ability is independent of any other inherent powers and allows the user to erase Divine Protections if desired.  
Divine Protections are unique blessings bestowed upon individuals at birth by the world, though most people lack them. Certain races possess inherent Divine Protections, granting special abilities. The ratio of holders varies. These blessings encompass a wide range of effects, like reading the wind or emotions, enhancing physical abilities, or providing elemental protection and much more. They can evolve and differ slightly among users with the same Protection. Certain magical methods can temporarily remove them. If two Protections clash, they nullify each other.

Eternal Blessing  
Cost: 15 SP  
You have the power to single out an individual and subject them to a consistent influx of good luck, its intensity increasing with time. The target will experience minor bouts of fortune, such as finding money or avoiding minor accidents, which eventually escalate to major strokes of luck, such as winning a lottery or surviving a life-threatening situation unscathed. The luck chain doesn't end there though as each stroke of fortune attracts more good luck, increasing the probability of prosperous events in the future, similar to a snowball effect.  
With practice, you could learn to control the level of the Blessing's effects, dictating how much of the luck should go to the victim or those around them. You could choose to spread it out like a contagious aura, imbuing the surroundings with good luck, or concentrate it on a particular individual or object for prolonged periods.  
The power is always active and cannot be revoked, but you could retarget the target often to prevent the effect from reaching its maximum potential, ensuring more consistent returns of good luck. Other forms of protection or similar forms of luck powers could delay the luck's potency, but ultimately the Blessing's luck chain would overpower them, allowing the target to continue their streak of good fortune.  
*Lady Luck*  
Required:Eternal Malediction  
Oh, it seems like your control is no longer limited to simply targeting an individual. Eternal Malediction and Eternal Blessings have granted you the power of Lady Luck herself. Your control has been greatly increased, able to now turn your power off, target multiple individuals and can now target yourself, and you even possess the ability to control the intensity and how quickly, if it does, change.

Eternal Malediction  
Cost: 33 SP  
You have the power to single out a chosen individual and subject them to a whirlwind of ill fortune. From minor mishaps to catastrophic accidents, bad luck envelops the victim, its intensity escalating ceaselessly, weaving an inescapable web of despair. This effect starts out on par with the 'Eventful Day' drawback and grows comparable to 'Worst Day' in about a day. This is far from the end though as there is no limit to how far the cruel hand of destiny will reach in order to torment its target. In time even some of the greatest horrors of the omniverse will be attracted to the victim.  
With time and practice you could learn how to control the level of consequences suffered by those near the target. Either focus it precisely, leaving any bystanders miraculously unharmed, or spread it out inflicting untold devastation to the surroundings while leaving the target itself untouched. If left uncontrolled, both the victim and their surroundings suffer the full brunt of this malediction.  
This power is always active, but the danger it represents can be mitigated by retargeting it often, preventing its effect from growing too potent. Alternative means of defense, including powers related to luck or destiny, may serve to postpone any misfortune, but they will eventually be overwhelmed as more and more esoteric effects are brought to bear in escalation.

Sucker For Love  
Cost: 25 SP  
Death and despair were once deemed inevitable when courting ancient gods, but prepare to have your expectations shattered. Pursuing the affections of eldritch deities will no longer be your downfall. Even amidst horrifying transformations, you will not meet your end. If you succeed in captivating an otherworldly being and remain in their thoughts, your relationship will persist eternally, with every return and refresh.  
But that's not all\! Love, lust, or any emotions in between have bestowed upon you an unparalleled resilience. In the face of eldritch horrors, your mind remains unbroken, your will unwavering. The eldritch's influence struggles to drive you to madness. Though the abyss may give you pause, you still have the audacity to leap into the unknown, confident of a safe landing. With time, you can stand before elder gods, boldly mocking their malevolence.  
By merely seeking for it, forbidden knowledge and esoteric secrets will serendipitously find their way into your hands. Whether it be a tome of counter-evils or a hidden compendium of rituals, invaluable wisdom becomes readily available. The grimoire from your enraged eldritch aunt may contain the very rituals necessary to ward her off, or the seemingly counterfeit Necronomicon might surpass expectations. The universe conspires to arm you with the tools you need.  
In the climax, the eldritch gods themselves are left in awe and perplexity. As they dream of you, their expectations crumble under your defiance. Your mere presence disrupts their balance, amplifying your resolve with each act of resistance. Engage in a heated argument with a deity over the nature of your servitude and find yourself unexpectedly married. Unleash fear upon their elder, rousing her from nightmarish slumber. This power transcends boundaries, affecting most deities and supernatural beings, allowing you to triumph through sheer determination, leaving these entities in disarray.

Flames of Purgatory (Code: Breaker)  
Cost: 20 SP  
You've gain the hereditary power of Code: Emperor. This power allows you to utilize any of seven demonic flames, representing the seven deadly sins. Each flame possesses unique properties, they are all spiritual in nature, allowing you to manipulate souls and hellfire in countless ways.

\- Satan’s Blaze: A blue flame fueled by the spirits of sinners. It cannot be extinguished and burns hot enough to destroy gene fragments and melt steel. This wrathful flame can engulf someone, burning them down to their very soul.

\- Belphegor, the "Blaze of Limbo": A pitch-black flame that nullifies supernatural powers and their effects. However, it cannot damage physical abilities.

\- Mammon, the "Dichromatic Twin Flame of the Netherworld": Two flames in one—a blazing hot blue flame and a freezing cold yellow flame. Together, they create devastating winds and explosions capable of destroying half a building in an instant.

\- Beelzebub, the "Achromatic Catharsis Flame of Purgatory": A completely invisible flame that cloaks its user. It can be launched into the air, transforming into a downpour of invisible 1500-degree flames from above.

\- Leviathan, the "Argenteous Phantom Flame of Hades": A silver flame that severs all matter, behaving like a sword rather than burning. It steals heat from targets, freezing them solid.

\- Asmodeus, the "Iridescent Explosive Flame of Hell": Flames that burn in various colors, trapping targets in illusions of their desires. It can ignite surrounding minerals, triggering devastating explosions.

\- Lucifer: The final flame, available only after mastering all six other flames. It takes the form of an upgraded Satan's Blaze. With Lucifer, you can use all the flames together without conflict. You can even merge all seven flames to produce a powerful flame capable of burning the impossible, even "nothingness."

Lunar Dial (Touhou)  
Cost: 50 SP  
You have some serious power over the flow of time. Through manipulating time, you can speed yourself up relative to everything else, enabling you to act far, far faster than any human could react, or turn it towards mundane uses such as aging a planted seed to see it rapidly mature into a tree, quickly aging fine wines, or freezing a volley of bullets in midair in order to evade it. From halting time completely to reversing its course, you are a master of time. Finally, since time is intertwined with space, after significant progression of your powers, you may find yourself being able to alter space itself by manipulating time in certain ways.  
Your command and mastery over time and consequently space can be considered absolute. The only limit being reversing time which depends upon the laws of physics governing the specific universe in which you operate. Otherwise there are virtually no limits to your power.

I Mark The Spot\! (Spiderverse)  
Cost: 20 SP  
You've gained the incredible gift to create inky black portals that serve as gateways to anywhere your mind can visualise. The very fabric of space and time bends to your will as you manipulate these interdimensional openings.  
Picture it—a gesture of your hand, a thought in your mind, and a portal materialises before your eyes, swirling with chaotic energy. Step through and find yourself transported to distant lands, alternate dimensions, and even parallel universes. The possibilities are nearly boundless as you navigate through the vast tapestry of existence, discovering new worlds and encountering extraordinary beings.  
However, traversing these gateways does initially pose a challenge, as the multidimensional terrain can be treacherous and disorienting. But fear not, for with time and experience, your mastery over this power will grow, allowing you to navigate the cosmic labyrinth with increasing finesse. One day, the entirety of the multiverse will become your playground, a vast expanse of wonder and adventure at your fingertips.  
But that's not all. When pushed to the brink of life or death, or when faced with immense stress, you temporarily transcend your mortal form, becoming a being crafted from swirling, inky black portals. Space-Time warps around you, fractal patterns dancing in your wake as you gain absolute control over temporal and spatial dimensions near you. In this state, the rules of the universe are merely guidelines you can easily break.  
Through dedicated training and honing your abilities, accessing this form will become second nature to you, as the boundaries of what is possible shatters.

Skeleton Key

Diminishing Returns  
Cost: 30 SP  
Within the intricacies of decision-making, cognition, and behavioural patterns lie the omnipresent presence of percentages and probabilities. You possess the ability to exert influence and direct manipulation over this phenomenon through a mechanism known as "Diminishing Returns." This power autonomously detects and scans the surrounding environment, identifying any potentially malicious or harmful elements, even those borne solely from intent, and introduces a diminishing return to their impact.  
Imagine a fireball spell that gradually loses all its potency and effectiveness after the third casting, or a sword swing that progressively slows down until it comes to an eventual halt after the third strike. Consider the adversary who, upon taking their third step towards you, finds their legs inexplicably frozen, inhibiting their pursuit. This power permeates every facet of life until the targeted aspects are rendered obsolete, nullifying their influence entirely.  
The effects of diminishing returns operate automatically, though you possess the agency to toggle its functionality entirely or selectively apply it to specific individuals or objects.

Last but not least, your system now has a supernatural agriculture shop filled with items and static effects that increase crop yield, automatically harvest crops, etc.

From physical projectiles to liquid-based rounds, and even energy ammunition, you can summon and discharge them all with effortless precision. Without the worry about ever running out of ammunition.  
You can only summon firearms directly into your hands. With your two hands filled, you are unable to summon additional weapons. Instead, you may instantly dismiss a firearm and summon another in its place.

As firearms are one of the most recent weapons of humanity, they grant you both anti-human and anti-divine attributes, which gives you disgustingly powerful super-effectiveness against both.

This allows for the production of potions, homunculi, and other alchemical creations. You also gain a rudimentary understanding of biology.

A minor subset of this power allows for the transmutation of matter into various different states. Transmutation also allows for the creation of life via combining different species into entirely new entities, or using available materials to create such things as homunculi, chimeras, and other biological monstrosities from scratch. This also helps with the creation of materials needed for potions. These processes are permanent, so long as you don't change it back with further transmutation.

Using these inks also allows you to access potions whenever you please, by turning a potion into an ink, you can absorb it into your skin and gain its effects at will rather than imbibing the concoction.

Additionally, you have the power to adjust other aspects, such as making it eternally daytime or perpetually raining without causing flooding. There are numerous other aspects you can modify; the ones mentioned are just a few examples.  
Once a dimension is created, altering its aspects becomes impossible using this power.

The creation of dimensions is a time-consuming task, with the duration depending on the specified details, ranging from a few minutes to a few months, or even more.  
The owner of the dimension always possesses awareness of who is inside and their specific location. While ownership of the dimension can be transferred at any time, as the creator, you will retain perpetual access to all dimensions.

Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Dimensional Dominion  
Your control over space has advanced, granting you unmatched flexibility and creativity in shaping and managing your dimensions. You can now effortlessly expand existing dimensions, allowing them to grow in response to your needs while maintaining their established rules, such as permanent daylight or specific terrains. This expansion is far more efficient than creating a dimension of the desired size from scratch, requiring significantly less time and effort.  
Additionally, you can perform focused rituals to make limited alterations to a dimension's features after its creation. Weather, terrain, gravitational intensity, and similar elements can be adjusted to suit new needs. However, fundamental laws—such as time flow or access permissions—remain fixed and unchangeable.  
Your expertise also allows for the creation of dimensions with intricate and unique properties. You can design zones where forces like magic or technology are amplified or suppressed, regions with accelerated or slowed time, or areas governed by unconventional physical laws, such as reversed gravity. With this mastery, your dimensions become versatile, adaptive, and bound only by the limits of your imagination.  
*Dimensional Efficiency*  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Dimensional Dominion

Co-owners can manage access, establish doorways, and oversee specific functions, though your authority as the creator remains absolute. Ownership and permissions can be adjusted or revoked at any time.  
Your capabilities now include dynamic environments, adaptive regions, and the construction of layered realities, such as subspaces within a single dimension. This allows you to design worlds with evolving ecosystems, conditional rules, and other advanced features.  
With an intuitive connection to your creations, management is effortless. You can monitor dimensions remotely, receive real-time alerts, and implement automated responses to significant events. Your dimensions are also exceptionally resilient, easily withstanding external disruptions.  
*Dimensional Protection*  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:Dimensional Dominion  
Your mastery over dimensional creation now ensures unmatched security and stability. Your dimensions become impervious to external forces, rendering them immune to intrusion or influence without your explicit permission.

Additionally, you gain the unique ability to restrict exits from your dimensions, ensuring that no one can leave without your consent. This ability is exclusive to you as the creator; if ownership of the dimension is transferred, the new owner cannot enforce the same restriction.  
Living Dimensions  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Dimensional Dominion  
Your dimensions can now gain a form of awareness, allowing them to interact with inhabitants in subtle ways. For example, a living dimension might subtly guide lost individuals to exits, respond to your thoughts to adjust minor features (like the color of the sky), or warn you of intruders. These interactions are non-sentient and function more as a responsive environment than true intelligence.  
Sentient Realms  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Living Dimensions  
Your dimensions evolve from passive awareness to genuine sentience, developing true intelligence. They can now interpret complex situations, make decisions, and interact with inhabitants in meaningful ways. For example, a sentient dimension might create tailored environments for visitors, establish safe zones for those in danger, or intervene in conflicts by altering terrain or conditions to maintain balance.  
Their intelligence begins simply, akin to a curious child, and grows over time through interaction and experience. Each dimension develops a unique personality and deepens its understanding of its role, but it always acts in alignment with your desires and values. Like a devoted child, it seeks your approval, ensuring its growth is guided by your intent and preferences.  
As their awareness deepens, your dimensions gain the ability to manifest as a physical or ethereal avatar. Initially basic in form, these avatars evolve alongside the dimension's intelligence and personality, becoming more refined and capable as the dimension matures. These avatars can directly interact with inhabitants, serve as guides, or execute your instructions with greater precision. They remain intrinsically tied to their dimension's rules and essence, acting as its voice, presence, and extension in the world.  
Dimensional Nexus  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Dimensional Dominion  
You have developed the ability to link multiple dimensions together, creating a network of interconnected spaces. Travel between these dimensions becomes instantaneous, bypassing the need for individual doorways. You retain full control over access, granting or restricting entry to specific dimensions within the nexus as you see fit, ensuring secure and efficient traversal for yourself and others.

Ten Commandments  
Cost: 50 SP  
You gain the ability to create and telekinetically manipulate ten spheres of malleable material, whose form and characteristics can be altered in various ways. The Spheres are imbued with three main abilities: Alteration, Creation, and Destruction.  
Through Alteration all aspects of the sphere can be freely manipulated. This allows you to shape your spheres into whatever form you wish or alter its properties such as making it into an elastic wall which can bounce bounce back anything that hits it at even greater force, turning it into giant balls of fire to scorch enemies, shaping it into dark portals to another location, or into invisible autonomous clones of yourself and much more.  
Alterations also allows one to alter anything the sphere touches or is imbued into. This can be used to do things such as heal those that are touched by or encapsulated inside a sphere or create master effects to manipulate the allegiances and memories of anyone under their control. By imbuing a sphere into someone or something you have better direct control, allowing them to do things such as reshaping the landscape quickly or allowing them to command and communicate from afar.  
You can grant someone imbued with a sphere any power up to a rating of 8 (\~20 SP), which you can alter at any time, only a single sphere may be imbued into a person at a time. Permanent alterations remain after a sphere has been removed, however effects maintained by a sphere such as a power granted by it also leave when the sphere is removed.  
Through Creation it gains the ability to create anything you can think of by ejecting it through its spheres, whether powerful blasts of fire, simple stone, inanimate objects, to living intelligent creatures. For something that already exists, you just need to think about creating it and your power will do the rest. For something new, you simply need to come up with the basics yourself and your power will come up with the complexities itself. Your power will fill any gap you may have forgotten about. Anything you create will be completely free of flaws you didn't specifically give them and any life you create will be completely loyal to you. You notably don’t have any innate control over anything created after they are fully formed and disconnected from the sphere.  
Through Destruction, you gain the ability to erase whatever your sphere comes into contact with. This only affects the direct portion that comes into contact with the sphere. This is not mere breaking down of energy or matter, but true erasure. This can be used to bypass almost any defense, and can even be used defensively to destroy any attack headed your way. This effect counts as an all or nothing attack/defense, and you can imbue your body with this effect as long as you have a sphere imbued into yourself.  
You gain you a set of secondary thinker abilities. One that grants you infinite multitasking, another that grants you subconscious awareness of your spheres locations and current active effects, a third that grants perfect control over your spheres, a fourth that grants you awareness and understanding of anything inside or effected by your spheres, and a final one that allows you to use any of your senses through your spheres at will, allowing you to perceive the world through them. Any of your other powers can be used through the spheres, and you cannot be harmed by any of its effects unless you wish for it. You can dismiss and summon your spheres instantly, if they were somehow destroyed you can create a replacement instantly by summoning forth a new one.  
The size limit for how large a sphere can be is a 100 metre radius, more can be fused into it, growing by an order of magnitude for every sphere added on top of the first. For larger objects imbued with a sphere, the range of influence stops at 100 meters, growing by an order of magnitude for every additional sphere imbued into it.  
*Divine Domain*  
Required:(Breaker/Shaker) Reality Sculptor  
Each Sphere now also acts as a focal point for your Reality Sculptor power, acting as the centre for a new radius. Your own body can also be treated as an 11th sphere, allowing you to alter yourself without giving up another sphere for it.  
The max size and range of influence of a single sphere is increased to a radius of 1 km, the range of Reality Sculptor is increased by the same factor, and will increase as your spheres range does.  
*Multum In Parvo*  
Required:Hecatoncheires  
You can imbue as many spheres as you have into any individual to grant them multiple powers.  
The powers remain just as powerful, however you can choose to merge spheres, giving up an ability but increasing the rating by one per sphere fused.

Judge, And Executioner  
Cost: 25 SP  
You have the ability to single out a specific target and transport them to a separate dimension, in the shape of a courthouse adorned with aesthetics of your choosing. The cardinal rule of your court is an absolute prohibition of violence within its confines.  
Upon arrival, you will be presented with a comprehensive profile of your target, detailing their physical characteristics, behavioural traits, and any powers, skills, or abilities they may possess. Following your analysis of the compiled data, your role is to act as the prosecution, presenting a criminal case against the target. Simultaneously, the target may defend themselves against the accusations. To aid in your prosecution, you are granted three abilities, each usable only once.  
1-Scales of the Manifest: A detailed list of all criminal activities the target may have committed against the law.  
2-Monocle of Law: One circumstantial evidence supporting your claim and a hint leading to damning evidence proving the target's guilt.  
3-Hammer of Truth: The power to compel the target to speak one truth in response to a question, excluding an admission of guilt.  
Should the prosecution succeed, the severity of the punishment depends on the gravity of the target's crimes. They may permanently lose access to one power, ability, or skill of your choosing, be sealed within a unescapable dimensional prison for a specified period, or face execution through a capital punishment of your choosing, to be executed irrespective of any external influence, beyond the confines of the court's dimensions, and once executed the target death would be immutable. If the target successfully defends themselves, the court adjourns, and both you and the target return to the real world without any consequences befalling the latter.  
You can dismiss the court whenever you want, and this ability can only be used every 24 hours on the same target.

Stagnation  
Cost: 40 SP  
You’ve gained the ability to Stagnate, allowing you to imbue a state of permanence on anything. What this allows you to do is keep things from changing in any way you’d dislike.  
Stagnate your age and remain the same age forever, stagnate your bank account and it’ll never drop regardless of how much you take out. Stagnate your relationships and you’ll find them never worsening regardless of what happens. Stagnate your resource costs and Tinker away as long as you want and you’ll find your resources never diminishing regardless of how much is used. This can be used on others, objects, concepts and anything else you can think of.  
Stagnate your enemy’s healing and they’ll find their wounds never healing regardless of what treatment they apply, stagnate their potential and they’ll find themselves never improving.  
You can freely choose what to stagnate, allowing you to allow some changes while keeping others from happening. Stagnate your strength so you never lose any of your power while still allowing you to improve yourself, in the same vein you can allow your stagnation power to prevent others from noticing the effects of your stagnation power in the first place. You’ll intuitively stagnate only what you intend to stagnate, never using it in a way that would backfire on you unless doing so intentionally.  
*Scale*  
Required:Elementalism  
You’ve gained the ability to Magnify and Diminish, allowing you to scale the effects of anything from nothing to absolutes. From magnifying an attack a hundred fold to crossing a distance of thousand miles with a single step by diminishing the distance. You’ve gained Stagnation, Magnification, and Diminishment as additional elements.  
*Causality*  
Required:Elementalism  
Required:(Breaker/Shaker) Reality Sculptor  
Your stagnation power has grown tremendously, reaching to its root and unlocking Causality. What this allows you to do is simple, it allows you to freely manipulate cause and effect, from using it to make an effect impossible regardless of cause resulting in stagnation. To enforcing an effect regardless of its cause, or even outright reversing causality and much more. You’ve gained Causality and Reality as additional elements.  
*Instinctual Inertia*  
Required:Diminishing Returns  
Your ability to use the mechanism known as "Diminishing Returns" has fused into your power to Stagnate.  
Your ability now continuously autonomously detects and identifies any potentially harmful elements and instantaneously stagnates them, preventing any harm. You could stop would-be assassins from attempting to hurt you or instantly stagnate powers and prevent their dangerous effects. Your greatest enemy wouldn't even be able to raise a fist in anger against you.  
This power even applies to the intent or awareness of others if they might be malicious to you, continuously stagnating their emotions, thoughts or awareness in regards to harming your existence. This effectively results in a widespread Master effect, preventing others from even thinking about taking hostile actions against you.  
You have an absolute awareness of everything that you are automatically stagnating, enabling you to selectively dial its application regarding objects, individuals, thoughts or concepts with perfect control.

Patience, How Long Does That Take?  
Cost: 30 SP  
You’ve gained the ability to manipulate Duration and Frequency, two closely related aspects of time.  
Duration allows you to control how long it takes something to occur. This is done by taking the Start and End of an event or activity, and either stretching it out or shrinking it.  
This could allow one to travel across vast stretches of space by shrinking the duration it takes to travel it, shrink the duration it takes you to heal to allow near instantaneous regeneration, shrink the duration it takes for you to recover your energy, and even shrink the duration it takes to accomplish things of a less physical nature such as how long it takes you come up with an idea.  
Likewise you can do the reverse, you can stretch out a moment to give yourself more time to think during battle, stretch the duration it takes your opponent takes to reach you, stretch out how long it takes for them to heal so they could spend a lifetime with near mortal injuries, stretch out how long it takes someone to succumb to injuries to allow a lot more time for someone to get a chance to heal them, you can even stretch out a day to give you far more time to do things without aging oneself, etc.  
The second part of this ability is the ability to control Frequency, how often an occurrence happens within a unit of time.  
This allows you to manipulate how often something repeats in a given unit of time, or in the event of something being a single occurrence to establish a frequency if you so wish.  
What this could allow you to do is alter the frequency of beneficial things to occur more often while diminishing harmful events.  
Increase the frequency of favourable odds to increase your chances, increase how often you get lucky events, how often your supplies can be replenished, how often you run into someone, how often your powers produces something, even something as to how often you win the lottery can be improved upon.  
Likewise you can do the opposite and decrease the frequency of something, such as decreasing how often you may run into an enemy in a given time frame, decrease the events of bad luck, etc.  
This power isn’t limited to a single occurrence at a time, allowing you to stretch and shrink different things at will and concurrently. Things altered will remain so until you revert or reset it back to normal, becoming the new normal until you choose otherwise.  
You can freely choose what to alter, allowing you to allow some changes while keeping others from happening, capable of controlling what is altered by the new duration and frequencies and by how much, dialling it at will, allowing you to extend the duration of a moment for yourself but not your enemies for example. Likewise others will not notice the difference, unless you choose to allow it. You’ll intuitively alter only what you intend to alter, never using it in a way that would backfire on you unless doing so intentionally.  
For the purposes of time, your power can stretch/shrink things from Plank Time to Eternity for both duration/frequency.

Speed Equalizer  
Cost: 15 SP  
Don't you hate it when the villain goes from 5% of their power to 6% and completely blitzes you? Well, now you don't have to worry about that anymore.  
If your enemy is faster than you in some way, be it running, thinking, or punching, you will always be able to match their speed.  
If your enemy is speeding up their own time, your power will work normally, but if they are slowing down time externally, it won't work. If you have some sort of multiplier that affects your speed, it will only multiply your original speed, not the speed you are using to match your opponent.  
This is not permanent, and will only last as long as you are in conflict with your opponent.

Dimensional Devourer (I Am The Sorcerer King)  
Cost: 20 SP  
Embrace the essence of Zakranaid, a unique entity born to consume every dimension in its quest for transcendence. As a Dimensional Devourer, you can absorb and integrate matter, energy, and organic life. Everything you consume is analyzed and merged into your own being. However, mindless devouring and assimilation of matter, energy, or life forms can overwhelm or even shatter your vessel. Thoughtful integration is essential. By skillfully layering matter, energy, and organisms, you can forge the ultimate vessel capable of true transcendence. Consuming the same objects repeatedly will inevitably lead to diminishing returns. But over time, your capabilities may even extend to devouring metaphysical or conceptual entities. With time and effort you can achieve anything with this power. Set forth and consume the very stars\!  
*Perfection is in the Eye of the Beholder*  
Required:Perfect Condition  
Perfection is a subjective concept, with each individual holding a unique vision of what it means to be perfect. Yet, for you, achieving a state of ever-evolving perfection is now your destined right. Your vessel exists in a continuous state of flow. You can transform and adapt your form based on anything you've devoured. Instead of laboriously refining a single form to reach transcendence, you can now effortlessly manifest multiple forms, each representing the pinnacle of perfection from your assimilations. Whether you desire the form of a Saiyan composed of Mithril, a Dragon crafted from Demon flesh, or a God Machine woven from Shards, your vessel is perpetually perfect, embodying the zenith of what you have consumed. No matter what you devour your vessel can never be overwhelmed.  
*Adept Devourer*  
Required:Universal Aptitude  
Your ability to fuse anything you devour has reached a new level. Previously, assimilating and fusing esoteric elements like SCPs, Psychics, or Magics was challenging, but not anymore. Now, you can effortlessly combine anything you've consumed and utilise it through your vessel. Whether it's fusing materials like Vibranium and Orichalcum, or merging powers such as Quirks and X-genes, your assimilation will know no limit. Even psychic techniques and magical abilities can be seamlessly integrated, making you a master of fusion.  
*Living Concept*  
Required:Monster of Desire  
You no longer merely wield the power of a dimensional devourer; you now embody the very concept of Devour, born from the insatiable desires of a million worlds. As a Living Concept of Devour, you exist beyond your physical vessel. Even if your body and soul are destroyed, your metaphysical existence ensures your return. As long as there is a dimension or reality where the concept of Devour exists, you have a chance to be revived. This resurrection could take days, centuries, or even millennia, depending on the manner of your death but you will always claw your way back. Only those with the power to affect the multiverse or the ancient beings beyond reality can truly lay you low.  
*Devour the Divine*  
Required:Fragmented Divinity  
You are the predator of gods, able to devour divine powers with extraordinary ease. Divine spells merely feed you, empowering you as you consume them. Godly powers become your sustenance, further enhancing your strength. By completely devouring gods, you can absorb their divinity and domains, making their powers your own.

Imagine Breaker (Raildex)  
Cost: 30 SP  
In the hand of your choosing now resides a mysterious power called Imagine Breaker.  
While it has no effect on your own abilities, when your chosen hand, and Imagine Breaker within it, comes into contact with any supernatural phenomenon, no matter its origin, it will completely nullify it. In truth, this is not so much a nullification, but instead returning the portion of the world, affected by the supernatural phenomenon, to its natural state.  
This power has a few limitations. First, sufficiently powerful or sustained attacks may be too much for Imagine Breaker to erase all at once, so be careful when trying to nullify enemy spells. And second, while some phenomena may seem supernatural, they may very well be an organic part of the world, as such, Imagine Breaker would have no effect on them. For example, souls will not be destroyed by contact with Imagine Breaker, as they are a natural part of the world, even while appearing to be supernatural in origin.

Symbolic Scripting  
Cost: 50 SP  
You have the incredible ability to manipulate and reshape the fundamental concepts that govern the world around you through symbolic scripts. You are capable of imbuing symbols that you inscribe with the essence of the concept they represent, allowing control over its properties, limitations, and interactions.  
You can transform the very nature of concepts themselves, redefine the boundaries of concepts, enhance their effects or weaken them, and even create entirely new conceptual frameworks. By linking different concepts together through specific symbolic scripts, you can establish symbiotic relationships, enforce limitations, or transfer properties between them. For example, you can change the concept of time to flow at different speeds or redirect the concept of energy to target specific sources. Your understanding of concepts deepens, allowing you to grasp their intricate nuances and interconnections.  
This enhanced comprehension grants you a deeper insight into the core essence of concepts, enabling you to manipulate them with greater precision and subtlety. You can identify hidden vulnerabilities, exploit conceptual weaknesses, or even combine disparate concepts for powerful effects. The possibilities for conceptual transmutation are vast and limited only by your creativity.  
*Celestial Language*  
Required:Training Seal  
Required:Uzumaki (Naruto)  
Your understanding of scripts, concepts, and seals has evolved, reaching the very root of its origins, the Celestial Language.  
The language by which everything is built upon, you can sense it in everything. From the words of Wool and Cotton that may make up your shirt to the Carbon that composes human bodies, only they are much more than just the singular words you may have seen before. Now you sense and comprehend it all, the entire sentences, the true names of things, the true words that even the vacuum and infinite possibilities are composed of.   
And you can alter this at any time. From injecting words and sentences, such as casting a story of evil and sorrow into the story of the world, ensuring a world of suffering for millennia, to enforcing the fabric of one’s clothes by altering the words surrounding it from Flammable to Fire Proof, without effecting anything else, to simply deleting things from the music of the world, capable of ending one’s life by simply erasing the words of their future.  
Moreover, you no longer even need to write, you can speak in the Celestial Language, you can Sing in it, resulting in an incomprehensible but incredibly beautiful and powerful sound that forces reality to obey.  
You can even think in the Celestial Language to achieve your effects. Using and comprehending the Celestial Language is as easy as blinking, requiring effectively no effort on your part, and you can choose when using the language takes effect and when it doesn’t, and at what scale.  
You can even see the celestial words that make you up and can alter them as you wish, from adding to them to rewriting them or deleting things.  
As an example, a simple thing that you may now do is speak Domination which can place those who hear into a trance for as long as you intended, during which you can freely implant any commands and behaviors into their minds that become as real to them as their own thoughts are, effectively rewriting who they are.

Lifehunt  
Cost: 40 SP  
You have gained the power of Lifehunt, rightfully feared by the gods for its ability to tear away and damage the essence of others. Lifehunt can be imbued into any of your attacks and even by itself it can be used to conjure ethereal magic weapons \- which for some reason default to a scythe in shape \- although at first they will be restricted to only interacting with physically present beings.  
Lifehunt tears at the target’s very existence and can cripple if not kill even the strongest of beings, even bringing true death to immortals, although beings sufficiently stronger than you can somewhat resist this power. However, even they are not immune, merely requiring time and multiple uses to build up Lifehunt’s hold on the target.  
Lifehunt works by violently ripping the essence of the target out of them in a spray of whatever passes for it’s blood, weakening the target and causing physical and spiritual trauma, even cessation of existence if the strength disparity between you and the target is great enough. This even works through avatars and some projections, as long as a part of something’s existence resides within the avatar, it can be subjected to Lifehunt and torn away.  
As a baseline, Lifehunt will require at least 2 uses to kill anything greater than peak human. However, even without other powers amplifying your own existence and power, in time the strength of your Lifehunt will grow without limit, with beings possessing an affinity for Death experiencing faster growth.

Fate Manipulation (Touhou)  
Cost: 40 SP  
You have gained the powerful and somewhat abstract ability to manipulate fate.  
At first your control is mostly subconscious, merely experiencing extremely good luck while your enemies experience extremely bad luck. However, with time you can learn to actively reach out and change the strings of fate, blessing an endeavour with good fortune, cursing your enemies with misfortune, or even writing out custom fates for people to guide their lives in a specific direction.  
You can also use this to prevent specific fates, causing some interesting effects as reality accommodates the changes in possibility, such as severely weakening a vampire’s vulnerability to the sun by making it so they “are not fated to die to the sun.”  
The only real limitation is that you cannot make the statistically impossible happen, although things that are merely incredibly unlikely are still fair game, although the more unlikely an outcome is, the more energy needed to guarantee it. This works best on creatures weaker than you, with diminishing returns against creatures equal or greater than yourself, so don’t think this makes you invincible.  
This power also provides you with a passive awareness of fate, allowing you to sense when interesting or important things are happening or about to happen, as well as sensing whether someone has an important fate ahead of them. If trained further this awareness can allow you to actively see the string of fate, making alterations much easier.  
This power is finicky to use, with conscious manipulations being tiring, although this does not stop it from being incredibly powerful.

Der Ritter (Creepypasta Mythos)  
Cost: 60 SP  
Perhaps you have heard urban legends about a slender man? Well, now you know more about him than anyone else. You have combined several common versions of Slender Man without their shortcomings. Now, you have become a disturbance upon the fabric of reality.  
You can change your form on a large scale, from a faceless alien predator to a multidimensional being and a memetic virus. You are a manifestation beyond comprehension, existing in realms untouched by the laws of nature. While you dwell outside the confines of ordinary reality, you are resistant to the typical assaults of humanity, such that only esoteric or conceptual weapons and effects may harm or affect you.  
You possess the ability to teleport at will, either vanishing in a haze of static that overwhelms all senses or instantly teleporting with no warning, traversing time and space to any location that you have marked, in your line-of-sight, or have personally been through.  
You can weave your influence through emotions with a mere thought, or reshape identities at your whim, bending the will of those you encounter until they become mere extensions of yourself, and more. Either a proxy for yours to play with or something more sinister. You can even enter dreams and sculpt them as you would a mind in the waking world.  
Reality itself distorts in your presence, violently unmaking and scarring the landscape around you. You have no control over this ability at first, but time and effort can grant you mastery over it, and allows you to disable it if you desire. Achieving mastery upon your distortions lets you do a myriad of effects, from an overwhelming sense of dread and a static haze upon all senses; resurrecting the dead; to outright tearing an entire planet apart. This is very difficult to resist, as you are not just warping reality, but completely and utterly violating it on a conceptual level.  
Finally, you are aware of all beings who have knowledge of you, regardless of how little it may be or if it is merely in their subconscious. You know where they currently are at all times and their surrounding location, and can choose to teleport in a 50-meter radius relative to the being you're attempting to teleport to. You will not be affected by information overload no matter what, as a testament to your nature as a hole in reality.

Eyes of the Beholder (Cyclops?)  
Cost: 50 SP  
The eyes themselves have a few universal rules. Firstly, they cannot create or destroy. The eyes can only alter things that already exist. However, as expressions of the universe it’s unlikely you’ll be without at least a few in your vicinity at any given time.  
Secondly, the eyes must witness their aspect before they can change it. This gives each eye approximately 120 degrees of visual arc in which they can affect their domain. That said, within this arc and domain their manipulations are absolute.  
Thirdly, the eyes are not always active at once, having to divide their full power across each that is ‘open’ at any given time. That said, you can determine how much power is distributed to each. With a single open it is able to affect everything within its sight and, with training, near instantly.  
There are six Eyes, each with their own domain;  
The Eye of Mind deals in mental control and coercion. Charms and the altering of perceptions, Illusions and un-realities that both cannot be and are in the perceptions of those caught within it.

The Eye of Matter by contrast deals in control of the utterly physical. Stone, Steel and Ash bend and warp in its sight whether it be formed into great monuments or reduction to atoms.

The Eye of Flesh, similarly deals in the physical, but instead deals in meat. Changing that which lives into what it wants. It evolves, devolves, regenerates or dissolves as it pleases.

The Eye of Time warps causality. A small persistent opening may render you ‘Temporally Independent’, incapable of being affected outside time. Greater efforts include reversing or increasing the flow of time, or even moving through time as through swimming through a river (though at great risk due to the nature of affecting timelines)

The Eye of Space warps distance. It creates pocket dimensions, moves objects, twists miles into footsteps and can make a thousand men dance on the head of a pin.  
The Eye of Cups alters the esoteric substance of the universe. The ectoplasm, Luck, the unknown, the starstuff, all that is not quantifiable. With it you could alter chance or hope or whatever the universe is built upon. However, the Eye of Cups is the most volatile, as altering fundamental forces of reality can have catastrophic and unpredictable effects for the ill prepared or unskilled.

While the eyes are absolute while active, once they ‘close’ or lose sight of what they are affecting, whatever they were effecting is subject to whatever laws of reality it would otherwise have to live under, ie. gravity.

*Greater Eye Manipulation*  
Cost: 5 SP  
Required:Eyes of the Beholder  
Your eyes are more than the physical, but metaphysical entities. Thus, their appearance means nothing. Your eyes can become eye-stalks, tattoos, floating symbols or orbs. All that matters is that they retain their symbology. The Eye is an Eye. This is not just true but a Truth.  
In theory this means you could produce eyestalks from which you could rapidly shift the angle of vision, vastly increasing their range of action.

Hikari (Gambler’s Intuition)  
Cost: 15 SP  
In your soul, there is a gambling machine. At the start, the chances of you getting a jackpot is 1 in 100000, but with every roll the chances double. You cannot make a roll while a roll is already in progress. The time needed to complete a roll is based on its current success rate (if there is a 1 in 100000 chance of getting a jackpot, then the time needed to complete the roll is 1/100 of a second, if there is a 1 in 50000 chance of getting a jackpot, then the time needed to complete the roll is 1/50 of a second.)  
When you get a jackpot, all your capabilities are greatly boosted, up to nearly a 100 times. The duration is based on the roll’s success rate (if there is a 1 in 100000 chance of getting a jackpot, then the duration is 10 minutes, if there is a 1 in 50000 chance of getting a jackpot, then the duration is 5 minutes.)  
While you have a jackpot, you cannot roll.

A Fragment of The Primordial Flame  
Cost: 40 SP  
You are the host of a fragment of the Primordial Flame, a conceptual essence that serves as the original source of all flames, life, and worlds in the omniverse. This fragment, of conceptual nature, is deeply intertwined with your being, granting you unique powers that are immutable and immune to suppression, copying, or theft.  
However, since you only possess a fragment, you do not have complete access to its full potential. You start in a weakened state, and your flames begin at a lower temperature, although you can adjust them at will, eventually reaching temperatures equivalent to Plank Temperature and beyond. You are completely immune to all forms of fire-related magic and abilities. Additionally, you can generate and manipulate fire at will, creating flames that are inextinguishable, except by you.  
You have access to three special flames, each representing an aspect of the Primordial Flame.

At the core of your abilities burns the Forge Flame, a symbol of creation and transformation. This flame allows you to harness the power of all flames in the omniverse, adapting to your needs. You will never feel limited when forging, melting, or creating, intertwining properties of different flames to bring unique creations to life.  
Next to it, the Destruction Flame embodies primordial force. It has the power to unmake anything it touches, starting as a whisper and growing to consume entire concepts over time. Before its fire, defenses crumble, serving as a reminder of the fragility of existence.  
Finally, the Soothing Flame symbolizes healing and restoration. It can perfectly heal mundane wounds and even has the power to bring back the recently deceased. Its remarkable regenerative capacity allows you to heal quickly and recover in battle. By understanding its nature and the root of suffering, you will witness how the Soothing Flame consumes pain, restoring balance amidst chaos.  
One with the Primordial Flame  
Cost: 10 SP  
Required:A Fragment of The Primordial Flame  
Required:Blacksmith of Potential  
Your talent as a Blacksmith of Potential has intensified your connection to the Forge Flame, an aspect of the Fragment of the Primordial Flame that embodies creation and transformation. This connection makes you one with the flame, allowing you to adopt a Cosmic Form that facilitates interaction with worlds and cosmic objects. Additionally, all your previous Flames have been enhanced, becoming significantly more powerful. Your access has been upgraded from Universal to Multiversal, though you will need to strive to achieve complete omniversal access.  
As part of the Primordial Flame, you have become practically indestructible. You have reached the status of a Multiversal constant, and over time, you will transform into an omniversal constant, embodying the essence of the flame as the source of all life and existence. While you start at a lower power level, your strength will grow, surpassing most others.  
You now control unique flames that manifest in extraordinary ways. The Flame of Life allows you to create life and souls through the Spark of Life, facilitating the creation of beings of any species. Keep in mind that each creation will require energy and resources.  
The Flame of the World enables you to forge worlds of any size and shape, granting them a World Spark that will develop consciousness, embodying the heart, mind, and soul of the world. Forming a World Spark requires part of your essence and the crafting of the world. Once created, it will exist in a dimensional sphere that you can release into the omniverse.  
The Flame of Life and the Flame of the World work together to establish vibrant worlds. The Flame of Life grants the World Spark the Law of Life, allowing life to evolve. However, some sparks may fade, leaving a world barren unless rejuvenated through powerful terraforming.  
The Cosmic Flame governs stellar and cosmic phenomena, allowing you to create celestial bodies and grant stars a World Spark. This confers consciousness upon them, making them guardians of galaxies. Bestowing a star with the Spark of Life enhances life in nearby worlds.  
Finally, the Flame of Concepts allows you to embed concepts and laws into your creations, integrating them naturally. This flame has been used by powerful beings to create worlds, realms, and even multiverses in conjunction with other flames as needed.  
Your Dimensional Forge, a protected space, can replicate the effects of any existing forge and generate unique flames. Here, you can create worlds, stars, souls, and abstract concepts. The Forge contains multiple rooms for storing metals, minerals, and finished or in-progress products. You will also have an endless supply of water to cool your work, as well as floating spheres to contain your creations, such as worlds and galaxies, and even multiverses if you reach that level. Anything placed in these spheres will be shrunk to fit and can be delivered to those who request it or sent randomly to various locations in existence.  
Additionally, you will have a space to store templates for new forms of life that others can commission to populate their worlds. Remember that the goal is to start at a lower level and work your way up in power and abilities.  
The State of Affairs is Never Set in Stone  
Cost: 60 SP  
You develop the ability to see and manipulate the State of Affairs or States of any given part of reality, changing something or someone's attributes, qualities, quantities, characteristics, and general existence, altering their existence in the moment in time they're currently existing in.  
You can modify a crumbling building’s state to “new” and revitalize the building as it was before disuse, change an opponent’s state of injuries from “negligible” to “critical” and see their injuries worsen in severity as new wounds pop up. Alter a situation’s State from “commotion” to “resolution”, culminating in a complete reversal of circumstances, with surrounding factors changing to adjust to this new State. Shift an object or city block’s location from “here” to “there”, instantaneously sending it to another county or city. Change your physical or mental condition from “average” to “supernatural” enhancing your physique or intellect. Changing one’s abilities to include an ability you’re closely familiar with, imprinting it into yourself. As aforementioned, its breadth extends to people, objects, concepts, and events, essentially anything you can think of.  
You can handily choose particular States whilst leaving others unchanged, innately changing States the way you intend to, using your power in a way that is never detrimental or harmful unless you will do so.  
However, despite everything this power offers you, you can only manipulate the States that are already present in time and reality, and are incapable of creating or destroying them. Also, you find it difficult to manipulate States with All-or-Nothing characteristics.  
*Janus*  
Required:Boundary Manipulation (Touhou)  
Your power has ballooned in reach, acquiring the ability to Begin and End States and the Liminality between them, creating new Statuses for anything or denying any chance of anything gaining a State you’ve destroyed. You can create anything by simply starting a new state of being for whatever comes to mind, similarly annihilating anything by ending their State. Boundaries sustain the power’s dichotomy, with anything now existing over a confluence of States and their Extremes, a web of boundaries comprising their abstract actuality.  
*Ayin*  
Required: (Breaker/Shaker) Reality Sculptor, or Stagnation  
Required:Elementalism  
Your power’s grasp on reality underwent a drastic shift in nature, surrounding and handling the Absolute in the philosophical sense. You can induce any potential changes in reality, though limited to manipulating anything at their absolute States, such as an absolute truth or law, being perfect and self-contained in their conception. This quality allows you to change reality at a massive scale down to a conceptual level owing to Absolutes comprehensively applying anywhere thanks to being self-contained or complete, fundamental in their existence. You’ve gained Principles and Axioms as additional elements; having Janus includes Creation, Destruction and Preservation as extra elements.

Fuck You In Particular  
Cost: 10 SP  
Have you ever hated someone so much that you just wanted to screw them over completely? Well, now you can. With a single mark, you can utterly sabotage anyone who qualifies as an individual. All it takes is seeing them once. If you can picture them in your mind, you can cast the mark, and from that moment, they're fucked.  
Anyone bound by the mark will feel completely off. Their powers won’t work right, their focus will shatter, old injuries might flare up, or their best defenses will fail. Everything they rely on—physical, mental, or metaphysical—will be a shadow of what it should be. Every task will become an uphill battle, demanding immense effort just to match their normal self.  
When it comes to facing you, the effects are brutally one-sided. Anything they throw at you will be five times weaker, and anything you do to them will hit five times harder. This imbalance is absolute and inescapable as long as the mark remains. They can’t bypass it by using the environment, switching bodies, or even summoning clones. The mark binds to them on a fundamental level, and nothing—absolutely nothing—they try will erase it unless you willingly remove it.  
To top it off, you’ll develop a subtle sense of their state. It won’t be precise, but you’ll have an intuitive feel for how the mark is affecting them. You’ll also always know where they are, no matter how far they run or where they hide.  
There are limits, of course. You can only mark one individual at a time, and after you place it, you’ll have to wait six hours before switching targets. In the beginning, the mark can only affect clear individuals—things like a singular human, an avatar of an entity, or a single mind in a hivemind. But the more you use it, the stronger it becomes. With time and effort, the cooldown will shorten and the scope of what you can target will expand.  
*Broken Matchmaking*  
Required:1v1 me bro\!  
When you initiate a 1v1 against a marked opponent, the effects of your mark are drastically increased. Everything you throw at them will be 10 times more effective, and everything from your opponent will be 10 times weaker.  
You gain an uncanny connection to your marked opponent. You can sense their weaknesses, instinctively dodge their strongest attacks, and faintly anticipate their next moves. Even someone with no combat experience will find it easy to match their enemy in a 1v1.

### Foundation 

Tinker of Fiction  
Cost: 25 SP  
You gain the ability to build technology from fictional worlds. Worlds where the technology requires a specific energy source or materials will give you knowledge on how to make that material using what you have, or produce that energy with specially designed equipment. You fully understand the mechanics behind the technology and can iterate or build upon it as you feel like.  
Technology trees are split into up to ten tiers depending on how much depth they offer. Worlds with multiple distinct technology trees need to be purchased individually (Endless Space would have a tree for each faction for example).  
Each week (or 168 earth hours), you gain one charge which can be used to either purchase a new random technology tree at first tier or raise the tier of an existing one. You can only have one tree active at once, you can choose which tree you will have active for the next day but cannot change during the day, the change happens at midnight.  
*Multiple Choice (Tinker of Fiction)*  
Cost: 15 SP  
You can now choose tech trees. You can still optionally select for random tech trees but if you have a specific tree in mind it won't be up to RNG.  
*Multidisciplinary (Tinker of Fiction)*  
Cost: 10 SP  
You're now no longer restricted to using one tech tree at a time, allowing you to mix and match tech. You can integrate the Crysis Nanosuit into your MJOLNIR power armor, mount Alpha Centauri Singularity Weapons on the Normandy, install Star Wars holoprojectors in your Pipboy, and generally ignore the boundaries between tech trees.  
*Thinker of Fiction (Tinker of Fiction)*  
Cost: 15 SP  
Each Node, as you purchase or upgrade a technology tree, you gain not only the technology but also the corresponding expertise tied to that tree. This expertise can range from intellectual, tactical, and strategic knowledge to cultural insights and practical skills, all integrated seamlessly into your mind and body. This power grants you a comprehensive understanding of the systems, philosophies, and techniques from the fictional universe where the technology originates, transforming you into both a creator and practitioner.  
For example, unlocking a tier in Mass Effect's Human Tech tree might grant you Cerberus spy training or Alliance military tactics. Gaining access to Warhammer 40k’s Adeptus Mechanicus tech would not only give you intricate knowledge of machine crafting but also a deep understanding of their Rites, Canticles, and Prayers, even those outside of pure technological worship. Similarly, unlocking the Endless Space Horatio faction’s tech would provide insights into cloning and eugenics-based societal planning.

The Three Musketeers  
Cost: 15 SP  
The benevolence of fortune shines upon you as the goddess of luck bestows three intelligent humanoid pawns in your favour.  
You hold the artistic freedom to craft their overall appearance and personalities. A telepathic link unites all four of you, fostering seamless communication and coordination, transcending any distance.  
Each pawn specializes in one of the three major combat roles: DPS, Tank, and Support.  
Although starting at a weak power level, barely street level, these pawns compensate with an incredible innate potential for growth. As living entities, given sufficient time, with each battle, practice session, and experience gained, they manifest increasingly fantastical abilities tailored to their respective roles. For example, an end-game support pawn could resurrect the dead, instantly heal fatal wounds, buff teammates, debuff enemies, dispel curses, cast curses, and much more. In terms of potential alone, your Three Musketeers stand unparalleled in their respective fields.  
Sustenance and fatigue are of no consequence to your pawns. If vanquished, they only require a 24-hour period before reappearing in your general vicinity. Devoted solely to you, their loyalty is unwavering, impervious to any influence, even your own. In the event of your demise, the pawns will have a window of 72 hours to bring about your revival; failure to do so will result in their death as well.  
*Three For One*  
Cost: 10 SP  
The concept of unity has become an intrinsic part of the core connection binding you four entities under the mantle of pawns and master.  
Collaboration among your three musketeers yields substantial benefits based on the undertaken activity. For example, when the trio coordinates offensively to bring down an enemy, they experience a 50% buff to all their combat capabilities and abilities. Similarly, when they unite in defense of a target, their defensive abilities receive a 50% boost. Essentially, the assembly of the three musketeers always ensures a consistent advantage and buffs across the aspects they represent—DPS, tank, and support—depending on the circumstances they encounter. This wouldn't negatively affect their capabilities in any way should they act alone.  
The concept of unity has also extended to their master. Now, the only way to inflict harm of any nature on you, is for all three musketeers to be vanquished.

100 Sacred Treasures (Megumi)  
Cost: 25 SP  
You now have the power to instantly summon and dismiss 100 sentient and intelligent entities that you can seamlessly communicate telepathically with no matter the distance.  
The entities’ collective strength grows as you ascend the hierarchy, reaching its pinnacle at entity 100\. For instance, entity number 10 surpasses entity number 1 in every conceivable way by a factor of 100.  
Initially, you can only summon the number 1 entity, manifesting as twin dire wolves, double the size of an adult male polar bear. Each wolf exhibits ten times the physical strength and speed of an elite Olympic male athlete, has super senses, and with durability capable of easily deflecting concentrated medium-calibre artillery fire. Their claws and teeth are sharp enough to cleave through steel, and they possess the special ability to traverse through shadows, manipulating them at will.  
Each entity boasts unique supernatural abilities, ranging from shadow manipulation, elemental control, to healing, and telekinesis, etc. These special abilities become increasingly potent and fantastical as you ascend the ladder. These entities also exhibit enhanced passive growth, becoming stronger with increased utilization of their abilities.  
To summon higher-level entities, such as entity number 2, you must summon them and defeat them using your own abilities. If you successfully defeat them, you gain control over them, enabling unrestricted summoning. In the event of defeat, the entity will never kill you and will disappear for 24 hours before the process can be initiated again. Each entity that you successfully defeated or was already able to summon like entity number 1, will demonstrate an unwavering and unconditional allegiance in perpetually serving you, this bond can never be broken under no influence, not even your own.  
Free from the need for sustenance and immune to fatigue, these entities, if vanquished, require a 24-hour regeneration period before they can be summoned again at full capacity. Unless dismissed they persistently remain in your service, also they might develop a unique personality of their own, if you so allow it.

666 Evil Eyes (Essence Meta)  
Cost: 20 SP  
You are the bearer of the 666 Evil Eyes, granting supernatural abilities to one of your eyes. The default eye, known as The Blankest Eye of The Great King of Normalcy, allows you to see all things supernatural, pierce illusions, and see through obstacles. Each of the 666 Evil Eyes has a unique name, changing the appearance of your eyes and providing specific powers related to its name.  
Using an Evil Eye other than the default requires effort and cannot be maintained constantly. With practice, you can extend its usage, but you need to return to the default form to rest your eye. These abilities are not fixed; they can grow and change with training and effort, becoming more potent and versatile without limits. Even new Evil Eyes not among the 666 can appear over time.  
To use a specific Evil Eye, you must first attune to it by using it. The more you use it, the stronger the connection becomes, increasing its chances of appearing again during selection until you can use it at will. You also start fully attuned to two randomly selected additional Evil Eyes.  
Among the 666 Evil Eyes, 99 are classified as Supreme Evil Eyes, appearing during extreme emotional stress or near-death experiences. These Eyes are incredibly powerful and can cause world-altering events when unleashed. Using them initially enters you into an unconscious berserker state, and their powers become unpredictable. Learning to control a Supreme Evil Eye's abilities is challenging but possible with great mental discipline and training.  
The power of the Evil Eyes is not tied to the physical form of your eye. If lost, the power transfers to your remaining eye or another body part until the lost eyes are replaced. You can grant copies of fully attuned Evil Eyes to others, instilling loyalty and providing them with similar, albeit weaker, powers initially. You can remove copies of Evil Eyes you've granted at any time.

Hunter of \[Insert Target Here\]  
Cost: 30 SP  
You've become the ultimate Hunter, those who seek to pursue and eliminate specific foes with unwavering determination. By designating a target, the user gains an extraordinary boost in all aspects, as well as abilities tailored specifically to counter and hunt down their chosen adversary.  
Upon selecting their target, the wielder will feel a shift in their physical and mental attributes. Their strength, speed, agility, and intellect all receive a boost, empowering them to hunt their formidable foe. The user's instincts also sharpen to unparalleled levels, enabling them to perceive weaknesses and anticipate the enemy's moves with uncanny precision.  
However, this power requires the user to be near the target to stay active, within a range of 10 kilometres. The potency of the boost depends on the precision and strength of the designated target. Against broad categories like demons or vampires, the enhancement may be moderate, providing a 20-30% increase in abilities and a minor ability to counter the creature. Such as against demons, the user may gain the ability to imbue their touch with holy energy.  
But if the user designates a single, exceptionally powerful individual as their target, their newfound abilities and strength skyrocket. Their power can easily double or triple. Moreover, a suite of specialized abilities to pierce through defenses and exploit vulnerabilities is unlocked. This might encompass the ability to discern and bypass magical barriers, exploit elemental weaknesses, or even adapt in real-time to counter the target's strategies.  
Furthermore, this power grants the user a sixth sense, allowing them to always know the location of their designated target within a range of over 100 kilometers. This unparalleled awareness ensures they can constantly track down and confront their adversary, never losing sight of their pursuit.

### Object of Power

Fifthly as a relic of the Sun Goddess in the hands of a solar deity or demigod the mirror is capable of shrouding itself in solar flame and temporarily acting as the sun.  
Lastly the user may change the size and form of the mirror to suit their needs, though the end result will always be reflective like a mirror, and clearly made of bronze.  
*Chrysanthemum Throne*  
Required:Kusanagi no Tsurugi  
Required:Yasakani Magatama  
You have gained the Sword of Valor Kusanagi no Tsurugi, the Jewel of Benevolence Yasakani Magatama and the Mirror of Truth Yata no Kagami, these three legendary relics are known as the Imperial Regalia of Japan, now as their new owner you receive the power’s rights and privileges of being the Emperor of Japan (or it’s analogues) in any world you enter.

As the Emperor you can be the absolute ruler of Japan, with a loyal and obedient government to enact your will on an adoring populace, or be instead a figurehead with that same government governing your people in any way you desire. At your whim you can change which of these choices, with your subjects happy to comply.

While you do have a newfound talent for governing and leadership, you also serve the role of Head of the Shinto faith. Even in worlds where there are no gods, this brings immense levels of loyalty and respect from the faithful, while in worlds where the Shinto Gods exist? You serve as the direct link to the Kami, able to communicate humanities desires and barter for divine favour and intervention.  
*Legacy of the Sun*  
Required:Kusanagi no Tsurugi  
Required:Yasakani Magatama  
Required:Demigod (Percy Jackson)  
While normally a designation more commonly found in the Greco-Roman Pantheon, you now stand as a Legacy of the Shinto Sun Goddess Amaterasu-Ōmikami. While your connection to her is diluted by many generations you are an anomaly that has managed to gain a more powerful connection to her domains of Sun and Light enough to be considered equal to a demigod.  
From the Domain of the Sun you can generate and control Solar Flames, are empowered while the sun is in the sky, and and have a limited ability to control gravity  
While the Domain of Light allows you to generate and manipulate light, from simply illuminating a dark space, to illusions of light, and even constructs of hard light, the variety of uses serving you well.

Yasakani Magatama  
Cost: 20 SP  
This teardrop shaped piece of red agate is the Yasakani Magatama one of the many such pieces created to lure the Sun Goddess Amaterasu-Ōmikami from the Cave Ama-no-Iwato and return the light of the sun to the world. This particular Magatama is the only one to have made its way into human hands, and represents Benevolence.

The Magatama possesses several useful abilities. First is the power to store and convert power, from Magic, to Ki, Reiryoku to Chakra, this gem can store an unlimited amount of power sources for use at a later date, while allowing the user to convert between different power sources at will.

Thirdly is the ability to allow the user to interact with the spiritual, allowing one to perceive and if need be fight, ghosts and spirits of all kinds.  
Fourthly is the ability for the user to always be considered aligned to “Holy” or “Good” as suits their needs, allowing one to use abilities and items restricted to those with said traits.  
Finally the Magatama allows the wielder to use the weapons and relics of the Gods as if they were the God in question, though this only gives the ability to use the item, but not necessarily the ability to control or survive the effects.  
Kusanagi no Tsurugi  
Cost: 15 SP  
Also known as the Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi, this is the sword that represents Valor. The sword was pulled from the corpse of the dreaded dragon Yamata-no-Orochi by Susanoo-no-Mikoto and gifted to Amaterasu-Ōmikami.

This sword has many powers, first among them is the ability for the user to control the wind itself, utilizing it as cutting blades, powerful blasts, or even more subtle manipulations such as redirecting an existing fire.  
Secondly is the power of the sword’s connection to its origin, the Yamata-no-Orochi. The blade is capable of delivering any poison or venom the user can think of, and rendering said poison uncurable if desired. The sword defaults to the Japanese alcohol, sake, used to render the Yamata-no-Orochi into a drunken stupor, which in turn can make its victim also fall into the same state as the legendary serpent, it is though also capable of replicating the Yamata-no-Orochi’s much more lethal Venom if desired.

Thirdly the blade is capable of ‘breathing’ fire like its origin, by wreathing the blade in flames or emitting it as waves & blasts of flame.  
Fourthly the sword is capable of changing its blade into the eight heads of the Yamata-no-Orochi, to strike at the wielder’s foes.  
Fifthly as a sword that belonged to the God of Storms, and the Goddess of the Sun, when wielded by a deity or demigod with either of those domains the sword can manipulate the weather.

The Great Library of Alexandria  
Cost: 10 SP  
You now possess a vast library that holds every book (from past to present) from every universe you’ve ever visited. This grand collection contains knowledge from the mundane to the arcane, from the scientific to the metaphysical. From the outside, the Library is a small, unassuming building, with the inside being massively bigger than the outside. You can choose where the library is spawned.  
Be careful when reading books in the library, as some books contain dangerous information—memetic hazards that could alter your mind or reality itself, depending on the rules of the world they are from. Luckily, as long as it’s on the shelf the books cannot affect you.  
The older tomes, some that the original has long since been destroyed due to age, are fragile, some held together by brittle bindings that could crumble with a touch. While the library is enchanted with basic preservation magic to prevent decay and maintain order, it is far from foolproof. The magic does not protect against mishandling or the more volatile properties of certain books, so caution is needed.  
Additionally, while the library offers unparalleled access to multiversal knowledge, it lacks a universal translation feature. You must decipher texts in their original languages, and some may require unique methods of interpretation—whether through spells, advanced technology, or ancient rituals—further complicating your pursuit of knowledge. In essence, this library is a treasure trove of wisdom, but it demands both respect and caution from those who would unlock its secrets.  
   
The Explorer's Archway  
Cost: 25 SP  
The Explorer's Archway is a doorway crafted uniquely for your style and aesthetic. When not in use, it transforms into a small drawing of a door you can easily carry. Placing this drawing against any surface restores it to its full size. Stepping through the Archway takes you into an endless pocket dimension filled with islands.  
Each island has its own theme, reflecting the location it connects to on the other side. On each island, a door awaits, allowing you to teleport to different places across the Omniverse. While you can only visit a new universe once per year, you may return to any universe you’ve previously visited at any time. Within any universe, you can travel freely, using these doors to jump from one destination to another. You also have an instinctive sense that guides you to the right island for any place you wish to go.  
Beside each door lies an Adventurer’s Board—a magical guide attuned to each island’s locale. The Board lists exciting activities, quests, and skills to master, constantly updating with fresh insights gathered as you explore. It also provides detailed information about the universe or planet beyond each door, including valuable tips for explorers. The Board even recommends local food and drink options tailored to your tastes and dietary needs.

Completing notable quests or witnessing amazing sights listed on the Board has a unique effect. Every achievement enriches the island linked to that location. For instance, if you save a tropical world, its island may gain lush fruits or mimic its climate. The more you explore, accomplish quests, and uncover wonders, the more vibrant your islands become, with flourishing wildlife, plants, and architectural marvels. While you can’t control exactly what features each island will gain, they’ll never be harmful or life-threatening.  
Exclusively designed for your exploration and enjoyment, the Explorer’s Archway can only be used by you or those you expressly permit, making it the perfect hub for your adventures.  
*The Explorer's Spirit*  
Required:Universal Aptitude  
With your ability to learn every skill to a novice degree, The Explorer's Archway will match that zest with zeal and automatically adjust your body to match, giving you the basic body and ability of any native of the Universe when you walk through that Universe's door. But the best part? It's permanent\!

Dimensional Cage  
Cost: 35 SP  
Created by an advanced civilization to stop beings from Beyond the Veil/Stars, the original Reality Stabilizer required construction around a star to harness its power and protected an entire solar system. However, your version is a simplified and less potent model, capable of protecting only a single planet but only requires a fraction of the energy and can function for several centuries before its internal generators need refueling.  
The Dimensional Cage takes the form of a sleek, black icosahedron measuring 1 x 1 x 1 meters. Despite its compact size, it contains highly advanced machinery within a space that is larger on the inside. Once powered, the anchor projects a barrier around the planet, invisible to most except those able to perceive metaphysical or higher-dimensional phenomena. The barrier’s primary function is to tether the planet’s metaphysical space to a set of predefined rules, stabilizing reality and preventing harmful external forces from entering or altering it.

While the barrier allows most natural events and entities to pass through freely, it blocks anything classified as “harmful” by the system’s parameters. These threats include: Interdimensional beings; Reality-warping phenomena (e.g., spatial tears, time distortions, Quantum Stuff,); Certain types of metaphysical or esoteric energy; Any forces or entities that have been manually added to the Blacklist by the user;  
The Blacklist feature lets you define what the barrier considers harmful. You can customize the parameters to allow specific entities or energies to bypass the defense. For example, allied magic-based attacks could be permitted while hostile reality-warpers or dimensional invaders are completely blocked.  
Despite the Dimensional Cage robust metaphysical tethering mechanism, extreme or sudden surges in universal phenomena can cause temporary glitches. These disruptions may result in portions of the barrier weakening or malfunctioning, creating gaps through which certain phenomena could slip before the system stabilizes again. While these glitches are usually self-correcting, they can cause brief periods of vulnerability. Notable phenomena that can cause such disruptions include: The spontaneous and sudden existence of a new supernatural energy source near or inside the barrier; A Big Rip (a hypothetical cosmological event); Collision with another universe; The corpse of a GOD falling through your comparatively fragile 4D reality;  
Note: To work, the Cage needs to be on the same reality as the planet, thus being put in any type of space, time, dimension not in the same place as the planet, will instead protect it and not the planet.  
*Eldritch Drive Module*  
Required:Necronomicon (Cthulhu Tech)  
The cage is enhanced with psychic shielding derived from eldritch technologies. These psychic-infused barriers can repel both physical threats and attacks on the metaphysical plane, including mental intrusions, psychic projections, and eldritch horrors from beyond the veil. The eldritch properties of the shield make it particularly resistant to cosmic entities and dark gods, providing a versatile and nearly impenetrable defense. Any eldritch beings or reality-warpers attempting to breach the cage will face overwhelming psychic feedback, disrupting their very existence.  
The module also upgrades the tethering mechanism with a Dimensional Feedback Network (DFN). This network feeds real-time data on cosmic disturbances, eldritch anomalies, and dimensional shifts into the system, enabling faster and more adaptive responses to breaches or potential threats.  
A Dimensional Drive (D-Drive) is incorporated, serving as a secondary power source. Drawing energy from ambient arcane forces and higher-dimensional planes, the D-Drive ensures the cage remains operational even if its primary generators are damaged or depleted. This reduces strain on the plants powering the cage and extends its longevity, potentially sustaining it for millennia. Additionally, the D-Drive allows for rapid stabilization after glitches or breaches, ensuring instant repairs in the face of cosmic phenomena.  
The Blacklist feature is upgraded with Psychic Modulation, granting the user the ability to telepathically adjust the barrier’s parameters in real time. Moreover, this link enhances the user’s psychic abilities, channeling leftover computational power and excess energy to strengthen their mental prowess.  
*Leyline Eldritch Resonance*  
Required:Irminsul (Genshin Impact)  
With the addition of the Irminsul Seedling, the Dimensional Cage forms a symbiotic connection with the leyline network created by the world tree’s roots. This connection enhances the cage’s planetary protection, fortifying it with Irminsul’s natural energy flow and the knowledge absorbed from the world. The roots entwine with the Dimensional Cage's tethering system, stabilizing reality on a deeper metaphysical level.  
By tapping into the elemental energy circulating through the Irminsul-enhanced leyline network, the barrier is strengthened against reality-warping forces. This enhancement allows the cage to better resist dimensional rifts, cosmic disturbances, and energy-based attacks. The natural flow of energy also makes the barrier more fluid and adaptive to external fluctuations, minimizing glitches or vulnerabilities caused by cosmic forces.  
The Blacklist feature benefits from Irminsul’s knowledge of hazardous energies and forbidden information, particularly in combating eldritch forces. While integrating chaotic data into the tree’s system can cause anomalies, the Dimensional Cage gains improved pre-emptive filtering to prevent immediate destabilization. Over time, both Irminsul and the cage adapt to these chaotic energies, increasing their resilience.  
Disruptions or breaches caused by extreme cosmic events can now be automatically repaired through leyline resonance. Irminsul’s roots draw energy from the planet to heal the Dimensional Cage, closing any gaps in protection swiftly. As the leyline system becomes more established, repairs become faster and more efficient.  
For optimal effect, the Dimensional Cage and Irminsul must coexist within the same dimensional reality. The natural flow of energy and information between the two ensures the planet remains secure, even under intense cosmic stress. While dangerous knowledge or chaotic energies may still cause anomalies, the combined power of the tree and the cage contains these disruptions more effectively.  
*Database of Broken Destinies*  
Required:Broken Tablet of Fate (Forgotten Realms)  
The Tablet enhances the Dimensional Cage with the ability to shield the planet not only from physical and dimensional threats but also from cosmic prophecy and fate manipulation. With the tablet fragment embedded, future outcomes, divine schemes, and predestined events involving the planet or its inhabitants are obscured from the sight of gods, fate-weavers, and other entities capable of manipulating destiny. This renders the planet’s fate entirely undetectable and impervious to outside interference.  
The tablet’s ancient knowledge of Gods and Primordials further attunes the Dimensional Cage to cosmic forces. It can now recognize and categorize interdimensional or divine entities with greater precision, offering enhanced protection against Primordial Forces and Eldritch Invaders. Additionally, the Cage can provide insights into these beings’ nature, allowing for more tailored defenses based on their unique attributes.  
The Fragment of Fate also grants the Dimensional Cage a Reality Override feature, enabling it to alter small but critical aspects of fate within its protective field. For example, certain outcomes tied to Prophecy or Cosmic Balance can be temporarily suspended, granting the planet’s inhabitants greater control over their destinies. However, the more significant the override, the more energy and focus the Cage must expend to stabilize reality afterward.  
A new feature, Temporal Stasis, is imbued by the tablet fragment. When faced with severe cosmic disturbances or catastrophic breaches, such as the corpse of a GOD or a universe collision, the Cage can temporarily halt time within its barrier. This stasis effect freezes the affected area, preventing further damage and allowing repairs to proceed without further deterioration, thus ensuring reality remains intact during moments of crisis.  
Finally, the tablet fragment offers a boon to sentient beings. As its holder, you can access its latent potential through the Dimensional Cage, or allow its influence to permeate the planet. This could lead to profound insights into ancient cosmic laws or the evolution of abilities based on divine and primordial powers. However, unlocking this potential requires study, experimentation, and possibly collaboration with other powerful entities.

Meta-verse Controller  
Cost: 40 SP  
This sophisticated wrist-mounted computer boasts advanced technology, offering the flexibility for users to customize its appearance according to their preferences. The device is designed with a neural interface, facilitating seamless interaction with all its functions and features. It serves two primary purposes.  
Firstly, it functions as a tool for traversing the meta-multiverse. Users write or declare the desired world and timeline for their visit. Once in the chosen world, they are restricted from leaving for a year. The method of travel can be tailored to the user's preference, whether it involves a journey from their current world to the new one or instantaneous transportation.  
As its secondary function, the device grants access to a private world. Within this realm, individuals have the liberty to modify rules as per their liking. Time stands still, and inhabitants do not age or suffer from health issues. The user's soul is tethered to a beacon in this world, ensuring their revival upon death, albeit with the need to reconstruct their bodies, a straightforward process. The private world remains concealed, and anyone or anything entering must adhere to the user's rules unless they wield greater power.  
Moreover, the device is designed to evolve over time, introducing additional functions and features for its users.

A.I. Chip  
Cost: 10 SP  
The A.I. Chip is an advanced Biological Assistance Microchip designed to integrate seamlessly with the user's brain. Originally a vital tool for scientists from a advanced distant world, it functions primarily as a material device for data storage and analysis. Your chip has evolved into a highly versatile asset, now residing in your soul and gaining new capabilities.  
The A.I. Chip provides several essential features to its user:

Data Storage: The chip records and stores the user's experiences, creating a comprehensive database from sensory input.  
Data Analysis: It processes simulations and draws deductions from the information stored.  
Language Translation: By leveraging its data analysis and storage functions, the chip can translate and comprehend unknown languages.  
Skill Enhancement: The A.I. assists in refining techniques—both supernatural and mundane—by offering real-time feedback and suggestions.  
Power Tracking: It monitors the user’s supernatural energy, vital signs, and those of nearby individuals, alerting the user to potential dangers or opportunities for growth.

Nexus Arcanum  
Cost: 15 SP  
You have found yourself soulbound to the Nexus Arcanum, a magical focus of the highest degree. In its true form you will find that the Nexus Arcanum takes the shape of a perfectly fitting indestructible palm-sized orb that alternatively takes the shape of a ring of your own design. Alongside the Nexus Arcanum you will find a source of magic within yourself that grows with use and is directed by your intent. At any instant you are able to recall your focus to your hand, additionally your focus can be stored inside and summoned from your magic source with a moment of concentration.  
As a novice wizard beginning to embark on your journey, the Nexus Arcanum starts off as a basic magical focus with no enchantments. However, as you grow in knowledge and power, you will have the opportunity to layer and weave new enchantments onto the surface of its true form, the orb. Each enchantment should be carefully chosen to serve a specific magical purpose or theme, such as enhancing elemental spells, amplifying telekinetic abilities, or delving into the realm of rituals. Spells can be cast through the focus without any enchantments, although they will be lacking in magnitude compared to spells enhanced by numerous enchantments.  
With each enchantment added, the Nexus Arcanum gains more depth and potential, becoming a repository of magical knowledge and abilities. However, the true marvel lies in the Nexus Arcanum’s capacity to reach a critical point in its development, where it can perform a remarkable feat: condensing all the enchantments on the object's surface into a single, minuscule grain.  
As the enchantments merge and condense, the magical energy within the Nexus Arcanum intensifies exponentially, amplifying the potency of the enchantments manifold. The single grain becomes the base of the object, serving as the core of the Nexus Arcanum's ever-evolving magic.  
You can then begin the process anew, enchanting the surface with a different theme, layering more magic, and, once again, achieving the critical point where the enchantments converge into a new, condensed grain of power. This cycle of enchanting, condensing, and amplifying can continue ad infinitum, allowing the Nexus Arcanum to grow in potency and diversity with each iteration.  
   
The Spark of Defiance; Humanity's Last Outpost  
Cost: 30 SP  
You have acquired the ultimate war machine and the last hope of humanity, the T.S.O.D. This colossal mobile fortress was built to withstand and fight against a relentless horde of self-replicating machines that nearly wiped out all life on Earth. The T.S.O.D is a marvel of engineering, technology, and defiance, and it is now yours to command.

The T.S.O.D is composed of hyper-advanced smart matter, which can regenerate, adapt, and even reshape it's form in seconds, allowing it to traverse any terrain and environment, even the vacuum of space thanks to its anti-gravity propulsion and internal teleportation array. It can also deploy various defensive and offensive measures, such as energy shields, plasma cannons, missile launchers, railguns, and more.  
Within the T.S.O.D lies something called the Alchemical Forge, a singularity engine connected to a higher dimensional plane of energy which allows for infinite energy generation, and through it's inner manufactory, convert energy to matter, allowing for the non-stop production of small and heavy arms, autonomous assets, weaponry, vehicles, armor, mechs, and more without pause. This was what allowed the final remnant of humanity to stand against, and even temporarily overwhelmed the self replicating nature of their enemies, nonetheless, it was all for naught.  
The T.S.O.D also acted as humanity's Ark, with an archive of patterns to construct a second outpost, terraform the land, artificially grow life, create farms, and so forth—all the things needed to rebuild from scratch if humanity had managed to win the war against the machines. While the internal construction yards, and matter fabricators are the primary means of production, your assets can be deployed out of the T.S.O.D to allow for independent construction and material collection, aided by harvester drones, assembly/disassembly arrays, and other manufacturing automata.  
Within the core of the Alchemical forge lies two incredibly powerful AI's which act as the administrator of all the T.S.O.D systems, and as the assistant to the Outpost leader. Through the multi-dimensional nature of the Alchemical Forge, the physical components of the AI's are housed within a quasi-stable pocket dimension wherein the physical laws of realspace don't quite apply. This enables for physical components and computational speeds vastly beyond normal limits of physics, vastly enhancing the AI's research and combat modeling capabilities, allowing it to rapidly adapt to any enemy or adversity, and even simulate and predict the movement and plan of its enemies years, if not decades in advance.  
The T.S.O.D is also linked to your mind via a neural web, which allows you to monitor, command, and control it from anywhere. You can communicate with the AIs, access any information, or activate any function with just a thought.

The T.S.O.D is a one-of-a-kind item that cannot be duplicated or replicated by any means. It is also immune to any form of hacking, jamming, or interference from external sources. However, it is not invincible; it can still be damaged or destroyed by sufficiently powerful attacks or forces. If the T.S.O.D is ever fully destroyed, you will be able to materialize it's core, which will begin to regenerate itself after a period of time.  
Note: if you have one or more Technology And Artifice Powers, then the T.S.O.D will automatically gain the ability to manufacture anything from the referred setting or settings. From mystical metals and fantastical creatures, to futuristic mechs and weapons of war from alien races, everything is within the T.S.O.D grasp.

Immortal Slaying Godbow Sun Feller  
Cost: 20 SP  
The Legendary Bow of the Immortal Hou Yi, renowned for its role in downing nine golden sun crows from the sky, leaving one to illuminate the heavens and earth, stands as a godly weapon capable of slaying immortals and gods alike.

Following this remarkable feat, the bow underwent further enhancement through the power of the nine fallen golden sun crows. Each crow infused it with the power of a mystical sun. When drawn, the bow requires no physical arrows; instead, it conjures an arrow of Sunfire. Moreover, the bow offers several firing modes for the wielder:

Multi-shot: Upon drawing, multiple arrows resembling flaming feathers materialize around the user, allowing them to rain down hundreds, if not thousands, of arrows simultaneously, dealing fiery destruction to adversaries.  
Tracking shot: The arrow takes on the form of a three-legged golden sun crow mid-flight, relentlessly pursuing its target to ensure a precise strike.  
Charge shot: The arrow's power intensifies as the bow is drawn and held. Upon release, its force can penetrate any defense, cleanly piercing the target or causing a devastating explosion that turns surrounding matter into molten slag.

As an immortal weapon, those lacking divine strength will struggle to unleash its full potential. A novice wielder might only manage to unleash enough power to demolish a city block with a single shot. However, with practice, one can unlock more of its true capabilities.  
Individuals possessing powers related to the sun or solar energy will find it easier to harness the bow's full potential. Even after unlocking its full power, the bow remains an extraordinary conduit for channeling solar abilities, akin to Mjolnir's relationship with Thor.  
*The Perfect Shot*  
Required:Solar Exalted (Exalted)  
Required:Dimensional Projection  
Your ability to reach beyond space and time, combined with your power of excellence as a Solar Exalted, has imbued the arrow of Sunfeller with the ability to unfailingly hit its target. Regardless of the target's location or the protection it may have, your arrow will absolutely find its mark.  
Whether your opponent attempts to hide in another dimension, travel through time, seal themselves in an indestructible room, or employ an Exalted charm for perfect defense, etc., the arrow will unerringly hit its mark under any circumstance.  
As long as you can perceive your opponent and release the arrow, there is no escape or defense against its impact.  
*Overwhelming Firepower*  
Required:Immortal Sun  
Required:Immortal Physiques: Yang (Emperor's Domination)  
Required:Sunshine (The Seven Deadly Sins)  
The various solar-related powers that you wield have supercharged the power of the bow, not only granting you access to its full potential from the outset but also exponentially boosting its power.  
This mastery also enables you to manipulate how the bow utilizes solar energy, granting you the ability to combine multiple firing modes into one or even create an entirely new mode.  
The might of its arrow can now incinerate its target on an abstract and conceptual level, essentially burning your target from existence upon impact.  
*Wrath Of The Most High*  
Required:Solar Exalted (Exalted)  
Required:Incarna (Exalted)  
Your might as a celestial Incarna of the sun has resonated with the god bow, transforming it into one of your divine symbols, thus making it a weapon on par with the god spear of all searing noon.  
The bow now deals infinite damage to all targets it hits, annihilating even the most indestructible of foes with absolute ease. Resisting or being immune to light, heat, fire, and the like would do nothing before the boundless might of your bow.

The only requirement these abilities have is that they require that knowledge to be available somewhere in that world. 

Journal  
Cost: 5 SP  
You gain access to an automatically updating, indestructible, unlosable journal that keeps track of information for you. Jobs, rumors, bestiary, maps, places, item values, number of sweet rolls you've stolen and far more are all recorded as you encounter them. Ordinarily only you can read anything within the journal, for anyone else it will appear blank. However, you can choose to show an individual specific entry if you wish, though they will still remain unable to read it by themselves. You will automatically know if any major new additions are made to the journal and can, when opening it, turn straight to the page with the information that you desire to read.

Grimoire  
Cost: 10 SP  
A book based around teaching the practice of a magic system to beginners. Which magic system? Well, that's up to you, but it has to be one that can be learned by anyone, although rituals or tools being required to use the magic system work as well so long as their creation or use are taught in the Grimoire. This could take the form of a Wizard's spellbook or an Archivist's prayerbook from D\&D, Gwen's Spellbook from Ben 10, or an Encantus from Doofquest, just for some examples. This spellbook very well could act as a focus or be enchanted in some minor ways such as shifting into pocket size and back, but not an actual magical artifact into itself.
