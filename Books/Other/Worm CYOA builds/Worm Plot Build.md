## Base Build
**(Trump) As the Plot Demands**
Cost: 25 SP
Whenever you need or want it, you will spontaneously develop a Skill or Power at a level that, alone, would need a bit of effort in order to solve what you needed it for. Skills are capped at their possible limit while Powers are capped at 15 SP. Always remember that alone those Powers/Skills can only deal with your situation if you put effort into it. You need to defeat someone wielding a Gun? You can now take a couple shots, so better make it count in order to strike them down. Need to hit a moving target? Increased Marksmanship that just needs you to be completely focused in order to be 100% accurate. Those Powers/Skills are somewhat temporary but can stack with each other for greater effects. Essentially, there's three ways you can lose a Skill/Power: you solved what you gained them for, resulting in a 60% chance to lose them; you exited a conflict, with a 30% chance for each Skill/Power related to the situation; and finally, every 24 hours each of the Skills/Powers you gained have a 30% chance to disappear.

_Coddled by the Plot_
> Required: Ah, yes. My anti-[X] Technique. I haven't used this since the Heian Era. 

You now constantly acquire new Skills or Powers that have the exact strength necessary to solve their reason of existence—though still limited by the SP cap—but where before you needed to desire or need something for them to develop now merely existing is enough for your power to gift you Powers/Skills. You could go to lay in your bed and suddenly have the power to always be wearing comfortable cloths, or walk outside and not need sunscreen even in the most sunny days. These Skills/Powers are still bound to the three loss conditions.

### PERKS:

**Olympic**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Entity
Your muscles, natural regeneration, bone density, intelligence, perception, and senses are all just short of Parahuman.

**Rapid Learning**
Cost: 5 CP
Your ability to learn anything is greatly improved. You learn both theoretical and practical knowledge over 5 times faster than your base capability. This only affects you mentally, meaning while you can learn multiple martial arts, you may not be physically capable. This only works on mundane skills and your ability to use power effectively.
*Excellent Education*
Required:Teaching
Required:Learning
Your extensive knowledge of both learning and teaching has significantly enhanced your own learning ability. You now learn 15 times faster, and those you teach experience improvements as if they had the 'Rapid Learning' perk and 'Learning' skill.

**Frankenstein**
Cost: 10 CP
Incompatible:Entity
You're a low-level Brute in durability, strength, and regeneration. A low-level Thinker in reflexes, reaction time, and senses. And finally, a low-level Mover in speed. You are resistant to Master effects and predictions about you are often slightly off. Thinker powers that sense your mind won't work properly.
*Unity of Mind and Body*
Required: Olympic, or Rapid Learning
Your mind now matches your body. You are a low-level Thinker, with enhanced cognitive capabilities that elevate your learning speed, memory, and analytical skills far beyond human limits. You can acquire and master new skills at a parahuman level, learning in weeks what would take others years. Additionally, your enhanced mind and body work in concert. When engaged in high-pressure situations, your mind shifts into tactical overdrive, allowing you to analyze threats, predict likely outcomes, and make optimal decisions in real time.

**Blank**
Cost: 5 SP
Cost: 10 CP
You become a blind spot for Thinkers.

Powers that predict the future cannot account for your actions; clairvoyants that peer into the past or watch over the present cannot search for you; people trying to conjure up information about you using only their power would find nothing.
Some powers will register your presence if their host can perceive you with their senses but they will be unable to gain further information, Gallant would be unable to sense your emotions, danger-sense would not warn their user of your actions, but they'd register your presence and show a neutral state.

This does not, however, stop someone from noticing that the future they were expecting has changed or the result and ripple effects of your actions altogether. It does not block direct observation either — in person or via technological means — and does not prevent a Thinker from building a model using this information.
Powers that work primarily through their user's senses can draw their own conclusions unimpeded. For example, if Tattletale sees you visibly getting upset at something she said, she would be able to tell that what she said had a negative effect on you.
You can, at will, allow selected thinker powers to perceive you and can rescind this allowance at will at any time.


**Mental Barrier**
Cost: 5 SP
Cost: 5 CP

You become immune to powers that directly affect your mind, emotions, or senses. This also protects against perception filters, hypnotic tinker-tech, body control or possession, and all forms of memetic hazards.  
However, physical effects like drugs, pheromones, or parasites will still affect you. Tinker-tech drugs or viruses will have their effects reduced but not completely negated.  
This protection adapts to the form you take. If you are a mechanical or digital life form, the protection would extend to cover viruses, hacking, and other forms of subversion or reprogramming.  
With your permission, you can allow powers to influence you.

*Blood-Brain Barrier*
Required:Frankenstein

You also gain immunity to physical effects like drugs, pheromones, and parasites.

**Trumped the Trump**
Cost: 5 SP
Incompatible:No Powers

Any powers and internal power supplies you possess cannot be drained, suppressed, weakened, stolen, copied, altered, controlled, reproduced, or otherwise manipulated against your will. Unless you will it to be otherwise, Trump powers do not work on you. You could even block certain aspects of powers influencing you, either yours or theirs. Such as being given a power and not being Mastered through it. You can be Mastered into consenting to a Trump working on you if you haven’t selected Mental Barrier, though.  
Paragon powers can Trump this immunity under certain circumstances (specified in the power's description).

**Powered Sustenance**
Cost: 2 SP
Incompatible:No Powers
Incompatible:Entity

You no longer need to eat, drink water, breathe, or exercise as your Shard or Power will sustain your body for as long as it has [Energy].

**Who Wants to Live Forever?**
Cost: 2 SP
Incompatible:No Powers

Your ability to age can be altered whenever you want. You can make yourself younger or older whenever you want. You can also fake age as if you were growing up normally, although you wouldn't suffer the normal effects of old age.  
This doesn't increase toughness or physical ability aside from protecting you from the frailty of age.

**Immortality Failsafe**
Cost: 3 CP

This perk eliminates any issues that may arise from an infinite, or just extremely long, lifespan. You can experience everything the world has to offer, visit every place, meet every type of person, learn every skill, and then do it all over again, each time feeling just as fresh and new as the first if you so desire.  
This does not affect your personality, only making sure that you'll never be susceptible to boredom, ennui, and listlessness unless you wish for it.

**All-Seeing Precognition**
Cost: 10 SP
Incompatible:No Powers

Blindspot? Hah! Your powers have no blindspots. They can see Eidolon, The Endbringers, The Entity, Mantellum, and all other blind spots.  
Your power does have one blindspot, anyway... it cannot see those with the Blank perk.

**Only A Sith Deals in Absolutes**
Cost: 5 SP
Incompatible:No Powers

What happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object, which wins? The answer is now simple, which one do you want to win?  
Now when powers of an absolute nature clash, you choose which wins, whether yours or another’s. You may also choose to have it switched at any time or have the effects simply cancel each other.  
This also allows you to enforce any of your powers, perks, and other effects as absolutes even if they wouldn’t be otherwise. This can be turned on and off.

**Noctis Cape**
Cost: 3 SP
Incompatible:Entity

You have no need to sleep, you'll constantly be alert and awake. You also have an infinite and perfectly eidetic memory, capable of perfectly recalling anything that has happened to you since you received your powers. Any memories prior to your trigger are remembered as well as you could recall them when you triggered.
*Savant*
Required:Frankenstein
Required: Olympic, or Rapid Learning

Your mind automatically stores and processes any and all information your senses encounter, even if for but a moment. If new information provides context for one you already possessed, it automatically forms logic links. This allows you to grasp complex topics after skimming through a book without requiring any additional time to comprehend its contents.

**Fan Service**
Cost: 10 CP
Incompatible:Entity

Now, calling you beautiful or handsome would be a massive understatement. While you are still recognisably you, your appearance has been overhauled to become an idealised version of yourself. The magnitude of this enhancement can be anywhere from being more attractive than a supermodel to making a goddess of beauty jealous.  
  
Nothing can ever tarnish your looks. Unless you desire otherwise, any wounds you receive will heal perfectly and not leave any scars, you will not gain weight, visible muscle mass, body hair, or retain any other unwanted physical changes that can be healed, etc. Even sick and injured, you will look magnificent.

*Siren's Voice*
Required:Master (Hypnotist)
Required:Taming
Required:Shaker/Master (Speaker)
Required:Present Perfect

Before, you would have turned heads, and now you can become the center of attention if you wish, as you know how to make the most of what you have to influence others. Your instinctual control over all aspects of your actions allows you to tailor your behavior to work in the best way on those around you, whether they are normal people, animals, or even supernatural beings, with your voice standing out the most. Your voice is like molten chocolate in the ears of others—so beautiful that it can bring out the best in people and stop conflicts between them with just a few words.  
  
Your ability to influence animals and implant ideas into people has merged into this, making it even more powerful. You know how to make someone fall under your spell within moments of meeting them, implanting ideas into all living creatures. Even the smallest things, like a whistle or a hand gesture, can activate them as sleeper agents, with your voice alone being able to greatly influence both people and animals.  

Aside from controlling others, this is also effective in conveying complex signals, allowing others to pick up on the general idea of the message or helping you build a successful career in show business, where people can't get enough of you.  
Most would mistake you for a Parahuman or even someone blessed by Aphrodite.

**Smouldering**
Cost: 5 CP

You will always experience dramatic moments where you _smoulder_—whether it's while admiring a breathtaking sunset or locking eyes with a formidable opponent. These moments also include simple poses made to highlight your good side. These intense, captivating moments are never unnoticed; there will always be someone nearby to witness and appreciate your presence.

*Magnetic Presence*
Required:Dramatics
You possess a dramatic flair that ensures you are always the center of attention. Everything you do, whether intentional or not, draws the eyes and ears of those around you. Your presence is naturally magnetic, effortlessly capturing the attention of any audience. This manifests through both verbal and non-verbal cues, from the way you speak to your gestures and even your silences. You exude an aura that can be felt by everyone, making you impossible to ignore. This flair allows you to navigate any situation with a natural gravitas, ensuring that you leave a lasting impression on everyone you encounter.  
You can turn this on or off at will.

**Adorable**
Cost: 5 CP

You are Adorable. No matter what you do or say, people will find you completely adorable. You can be covered in blood and people will still find you too cute to resist, if a bit creepy. This affects your subconscious actions and both conscious actions and physical appearance to a limited degree. You can toggle this Perk on and off.

**Peaceful Vibes**
Cost: 2 CP
Incompatible:Personality Conflict

People with the same goals, principles, or personality are more likely to mesh well together. Even if they were your enemies yesterday, you find it easier to befriend and work with them. Yesterday's enemies can be today's friends, against a common foe the both of you somehow work wonderfully together.  
It's easier for people to set aside their differences and work together. You'll be more likely to work well together on a team. This even makes actions like Tinkering together easier.

**Invictus**
Cost: 10 CP

Your will is absolute, boundless, and unbreakable. Maybe it’s your ideals, an all-consuming ambition, or maybe it's just a rock-solid certainty in how you see the world. You are patient beyond belief, even capable of spending countless hours doing mind-numbing tasks. Your willpower is endless and no matter how difficult the situation, even if you're torn in half, locked in a time loop of endless agony for thousands of years, or subjected to a fate worse than death, you'll be able to shrug it off. You will never be left drifting without a sense of purpose, and though you might change your goals and refine your ideals you always have the motivation to fuel turning them into a reality.  
  
This will greatly bolster your sense of self in the face of adversity, and you’ll be able to plant your feet when everyone else is giving up. Of course, you still have emotions and you can still be hurt emotionally, but you'll always be able to maintain your composure and keep your emotions from ruling your decision-making. Take care that you don't become so tunnel-visioned that you fail to see others as actual people with agency.

**Well-Adjusted**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Cold Heart

You won't lose your sanity or rationality under any circumstances unless you're being controlled by a power. And even if you somehow did, no matter the circumstances, you will never lose your humanity and empathy. Your team, family, or friends will always be there to bring you back from the abyss. Your personal issues are much easier to work through and even without help you'll be able to get through them in time. This might take a while if it's bad, but you'll make it out eventually.  
  
This also makes you highly resistant to mental health problems and emotional manipulation, though not completely immune. You’re also really good at helping others through their issues, and it’ll stick more often than not as long as you can get through to them.

**Patience of a Saint**
Cost: 4 CP

Your patience is inexhaustible. You could sit without moving for days with no problem, or easily spend countless hours on a single, mind-numbing task.

**Reputable**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Disreputable

You gain a reputation easily, a spark of appearance that makes you shine. Your accomplishments are often embellished by others or people just credit things happening to you. Anything you do will be amazing and astounding. Even in losing, you seem to lose gracefully and in winning you seem like an unsurmountable giant. The impression you give can change depending on how you want, you could be cool or cute, handsome or beautiful. The way you move, talk, and fight will always be astonishing, even if you didn't intend to.  
This makes it easier to bluff your way out of a situation and gives you leverage in getting what you want. This can be toggled on and off.

**'Plot' Armor**
Cost: 5 CP

You're not unlucky. You won't get killed by accident, only by something someone did intentionally. Someone has to go out of their way to kill you if they want you dead. This power doesn't protect you from Endbringers (or any other truly overpowered or world-ending threats).

**Just as Planned**
Cost: 10 CP

The fate or "canon" of this world is molded by those much higher than yourself, and unless intentionally acted against, shall follow the same path. Unless you involve yourself directly in the events foretold by Wildbow, everything shall follow the path he laid out more or less.  
Arriving on a Crossover or an Alternate Earth will also ensure that they'll follow the path laid out by their respective author(s) unless you directly involve yourself.

**Manton Protected**
Cost: 5 SP
Cost: 10 CP

The inside of your body is protected against influences that attempt to target it. For example, a telekinetic cannot crush your heart inside of your chest.  
You also gain some measure of resistance to esoteric attacks like instant death or erasure. This is not complete immunity and will still hurt you, severely, but you will at least have a chance to survive.

**Ripple Effect Proof Memory**
Cost: 10 SP

When the timeline changes and you suddenly gain a new history, you remember both the new timeline _and_ the old timeline, with the memories helpfully ‘separated’ so you don’t get them confused while, optionally, still experiencing the full emotional impact. This works whether the new timeline is caused by a ‘Groundhog Day’ style timeloop, a Save and Load system, a time machine, a wish that rewrites history, or something weirder.  
  
If you want, you can choose to emotionally distance yourself from the memories of the old timeline (such as if in the old timeline you got tortured by Skynet or something) or the new timeline (such as if you got ~~kidnapped~~ **adopted** by your nemesis as a kid and then ~~abused~~ **trained** to become a loyal enforcer), making them as impactful as a story you read instead of something you experienced firsthand, and if needed can reverse this at will.  
  
**Note**: This doesn’t do a thing if someone just mind controls you into believing that something happened in the past, such as you being their childhood friend, it's only if history actually changes. If you want immunity to that, get _Mental Barrier_ or something.

*Ripple Effect Proof Body*
Required:Manton Protected

Your resistance to supernatural attempts to influence has gained a new dimension, allowing you to resist time travel-based alterations. Now, if someone changes the past in such a way that your body is altered, you can reject the change. For example, if the new timeline resulted in you losing an eye, you can choose to reject that change and regain your binocular vision. Like before, bring the change back if needed.  
  
This has a limit, though; the more powerful the being / force that created this new timeline is, the less you can resist the changes. If the person who did it is weaker or as strong as you, you can reject the physical changes just fine. If they are more than double but less than an order of magnitude stronger than you, you can reject crippling changes like a missing limb or a slave seal tattoo, but cosmetic changes like a new haircut or mundane tattoos can’t be rejected. If they are more than a hundred times stronger than you, then lethal changes can be rejected, but crippling changes like loss of limbs can’t be. If they are more than a thousand times stronger than you, just accept your fate.  
  
If you have _**Golden Perks**_ as well, you can reject _any_ retroactive changes to your body, no matter how much stronger the source is compared to you.  
  
**Note**: This only works with time travel or other retroactive reality shifts. If someone just uses their power to change your hair color or something without altering the past (and Manton Protected didn’t already stop it), you can’t use this to reverse it.

**Homecoming**
Cost: 5 SP

Any teleportation or similar power you possess now allows you to travel to other universes. You can travel to any universe you have previously been to, including your home universe, as well as target universes based on any knowledge you possess, such as memories you had prior to gaining powers, awareness of a setting through some form of media, etc.  
If you have no such ability, you can still travel to other worlds by accessing the medium in which it is depicted. For example, a Harry Potter book for the Harry Potter universe, a Skyrim game for Skyrim, etc.

**Resume**
Cost: 15 SP

If you possess any means to travel across the multiverse, you can choose to re-enter any universe you have previously been to at the exact same time you left it, no matter how much time has passed. This includes your original world.  
If you have any powers that allow you to interact with other universes without actually moving to them, they will count as if you were there when used.

**Holding Back**
Cost: 5 SP

Every single aspect of your powers, strength, and perks can be selectively toggled and dialed to the point they can be turned completely off. You can also select people and individuals who are not affected by your perks and powers, making it seem as if they're capable of withstanding reality-breaking attacks. You can scale your reality-ending destruction to be tuned down to cause mild concussions, granting you the ability to not overkill everything in existence. As long as you wish it, it’s almost impossible to kill someone if you don't want to.  
This does not work on drawbacks or on perks that rely on items like Wealthy.

**Hidden Strength**
Cost: 3 SP

Now you can selectively conceal your true capabilities. When doing so, no device or ability will be able to detect your hidden powers.  
You can either conceal any or all of your powers and skills completely, appearing as if you never possessed them in the first place, hide only one some aspects of those, or, alternatively, just limit the detectable level of strength, appearing weaker than you truly are.

*Red Herring*
Required:Explained
You now have control over how others interpret the nature of any and all of your powers and abilities. For example, you can disguise any of your powers so that they appear to belong to a completely different power system, such as masking your magic powers as psionics and vice versa. This is so powerful that even if the nature of powers may be revealed through something like a blood test, everyone will still come to the conclusion that your powers are exactly what you present as.  
  
While not granting you any direct buffs, as the nature of your powers doesn't truly change, if something in the world is conditioned upon you having the right nature of power, you can appear as if you satisfy any such requirement.

**Accentuate the Positive**
Cost: 8 SP
Cost: 8 CP

You are now immune to the negative side effects of power sources from outside yourself, whether it be combat drugs, enchantments, items, divine blessings, curses, and anything that empowers you or that you wield in some manner.  
  
This means that if a drug could enhance your strength tenfold but reduced your life by half, you could take it as you please with no worry for the cost as it doesn’t impact you.  
  
Likewise, if an item granted you the power to see the future at the cost of inevitable madness, feel free to use it as you please as your mind remains as sharp and crystal clear decades after, as before you even touched the item.  
  
Made a pact with a demon for the ability to manipulate light, the cost being your soul, weakness to holy objects, and an inability to use your powers or even walk on holy ground? Walk into a church, pray, utilize your light to create an interesting spectacle for the parishioners, and fret not for your soul is still your own.  
  
This also comes with complete immunity to addiction.  
The perk doesn’t expand upon the power, nor does it add new abilities; it merely removes the complications that may arise from the power.  
This allows you to benefit from all the positives of outside power sources, with any negative mechanics and complications wiped away or shifted to be non-detrimental, such as a demonic force’s natural weakness and aversion to holy objects. However, it would not add new aspects; it removes negative effects and factors, but doesn’t create new beneficial ones.

**Eliminate the Negative**
Cost: 12 SP
Cost: 12 CP

You are now immune to the negative side effects of your self-derived powers.  
  
For example, magic that may have used your emotions and/or stamina to fuel its power now has a separate pool to draw upon so as to not leech off you.  
  
Likewise, any aspect of your abilities that negatively affects your mental state, your body, your soul, or any other aspect of yourself is wiped away or shifted to a non-detriment.  
  
Are you a Kryptonian weak to Green Kryptonite? Now chuck that useless rock as if it was some common quartz rock. Let those grunts think they have a chance because they’ve got their magic bullet only to laugh in their face as that bullet does nothing.  

Your magic leaves you barely able to stand, fog your mind, or scar your soul? Not anymore. Fire as many spells as you wish—your health, body, mind, and soul remains unfazed. Your magic instead drains from a separate pool that replenishes over time.  
Your bloodline grants you the power to enter a form that gives phenomenal cosmic power in exchange for giving up your humanity? Feel free to shift back and forth as you wish. Enjoy the benefits of remaining who you were with all the pleasure of having all that power.  
  
The perk doesn’t expand upon the power, nor does it add new abilities; it merely removes the complications that may arise from the power.  
This allows you to benefit from all the positives of your powers. Any drawbacks, powers, biological traits, or magic systems that may have held any negative complication or mechanics have been wiped away or shifted to be non-detrimental. However, it would not add new aspects; it removes negative effects and factors but doesn’t create new beneficial ones.  
It would remove a Kryptonian's natural weakness to Green Kryptonite, but not their dependence on sunlight, nor would it grant new abilities for perceived limitations.

**Platinum Kryptonite**
Cost: 5 SP
Cost: 5 CP
Required:Accentuate the Positive
Required:Eliminate the Negative

Alongside eliminating any drawbacks your powers come with, you can turn them into strengths.  
  
Whenever you encounter an effect that would naturally weaken or debilitate you as a result of the powers you possess, you are instead enhanced by the same margin.  
  
For example, as a Kryptonian, Green Kryptonite would amplify your power, pushing you as far away in strength from your normal form as you are to humans.  
  
This applies automatically; however, you can choose for it to not take effect if you wish, for any reason.

**Comic Book Physics**
Cost: 5 SP
Cost: 5 CP

In some universes, certain champions of justice travel through the atmosphere at superluminal speeds without igniting everything for miles and lift buildings, even though they should crumble due to structural integrity. Now, so can you.  
  
Not only do you have any required secondary powers that your primary powers might require to be used without horrifying or destructive implications, but, provided you have the powers for it, you can lift buildings without them falling apart and move at speeds in the multiple digits without destroying everything if you don't want to.  
  
You now have complete control over the amount of collateral damage your attacks can output such that a planet-busting punch will only affect your enemy, not the planet itself. It all just works.

**Friendly**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Personality Conflict
Incompatible:Lonely

You find it easier to make friends, and the friends you do make are in it for the long run.

*Joys of Friendship, Passion of Rivalry*
Required:Communication
Required:Connection

Some people might think you're the child of a Shounen Hero and a Magical Girl, given how easily you can form and maintain so many friendships at once. These bonds are genuine and deep, and they begin to have a positive impact on those you connect with.  
  
As a result, they become better at communicating their feelings and intentions to others. Having someone with whom they can speak frankly allows them to grow in ways they might not have been able to if they were alone. Gaining the encouragement to take risks or stand up for themselves are just a few examples of how you and your friendships uplift each other, making each of you better than before.  
This improvement can also be seen in rivals. At first, it may seem like you and they are only getting better at defeating each other and others, but as time goes on, both you and they find other aspects of your lives improving thanks to having someone to compete against. Even something as simple and complex as ideals is refined through this conflict between you.  
For you, friendship almost seems like a power in itself. Though, no giant friendship lasers included—you'll have to look elsewhere for that.

**A Significant Other**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Lonely

Through a stroke of fate, you either have or will soon find your soulmate. Maybe you’ve yet to meet them, or maybe—if you are a reincarnation—you already have prior history together; every single detail is completely up to you. You can leave this entirely to chance, or you may optionally choose now whom this may be, anyone of your choice. Either way, when you next cross paths, you’ll both immediately and unmistakably know that you’re meant for each other.  
  
They are matched to your ideal in every way, and you are the same for them. Whether it’s a romantic interest, a friendship, or anything else—you're perfect for each other. You get along easily and flawlessly, your bond is unbreakable, you're both willing to go to hell and back for one another and support each other to be the best versions of yourselves, and every bit of love is reciprocated. All you need is each other, and even if that’s all you had, it would still be the happiest time of your life.  
  
If you genuinely want this level of relationship or to develop one with someone in the future, you’ll find that things will very quickly and organically progress to this level.


**Peaceful Life**
Cost: 10 CP
Incompatible:Always on The Clock

With all those troubles that come with a super life, you can never have enough "me time". This Perk helps you by letting all your troubles take a "day off". An eldritch monster is trying to devour reality, and you are the only one who can stop it? Relax, it won't happen until you have your "free day".  
  
A super tinker is planning to take over the world? Relax, that won't happen when you are playing your games, having a date, or even on the beach. This perk takes action from time to time while you are relaxing or too stressed.

**World Clean**
Cost: 2 SP

Your body will be completely self-cleaning. The moment you close your eyes, and wish to be clean, any filth, dirt, and grime built up on your body and or your clothing will magically disappear, this also includes your dental hygiene. Not only that, but you'll also carry a wonderful scent, perfectly tailored to the liking of yourself and those around you, such that everyone smells you a little different, but loves it all the same. You'll both smell, feel, and be heavenly fresh forevermore.

**Power Tweak (All)**
Cost: 10 SP

You can change how any aspects of any of your powers, objects of powers, or perks work. This doesn't make it more powerful but can change some of its mechanics.  
  
You can use this to alter the mechanics of some of your powers or OoPs, a single one of them, fuse all of them or allow them to be expressed through one power or object, or any combination of alterations you can think of. This doesn’t allow you to make yourself more powerful on its own.

**Tailor Made**
Cost: 2 SP
Required: Power Tweak (All)

Your powers, OoPs, and perks are all adjusted to fit you perfectly. The little nuances and the subtle details that you may have otherwise overlooked or miscalculated are no longer an issue, instead all the little nuances and details are smoothed out entirely on their own to become the best possible fit for you.

*Personal Touch*
Required: Thematic
Your powers, objects of powers, and perks aren’t just fixed in at one point in time; instead, they’ll alter and shift to continuously match you perfectly.  
This also allows you to manually make adjustments at will, freely shifting it to suit your needs. If you prefer, you can always allow it to default back to shifting into an optimal state for you once more.

**Serendipitous Luck**
Cost: 3 CP

The universe conspires in your favor, no matter what you seek to achieve or overcome. Good luck follows you at every turn, increasing the likelihood of success and decreasing the likelihood of failure in all your endeavors, no matter how challenging they may be. Luck smiles upon you always. This might not help you win the lottery, or find your soulmate but it can be felt in almost every aspect of your life.

**Sixth Sense**
Cost: 2 SP

You possess an innate ability to perceive and anticipate danger or hidden information.

**Inner Harmony**
Cost: 4 CP

You have attained inner peace and balance, allowing you to remain calm and centered in any situation.

**Charismatic Aura**
Cost: 3 CP

You radiate charisma and magnetic charm, effortlessly drawing others towards you and influencing them positively.

**Inheritable**
Cost: 5 SP
Incompatible: No Powers

Your powers, perks, and skills can be passed down to your descendants, and to adopted children who have been in your care for at least 5 years, or not in any combination of your choice.  
  
Taking this with reincarnation will allow you to retroactively add any of your powers, perks, and skills to any family members or loved ones in your new life in any combination of your choice. You can choose for their versions to be weaker than your own, or with certain weaknesses, or to manifest different expressions of power.  
  
You can apply this to any ancestors you may have as if you inherited it from them instead of the other way around.

**Heir to the Throne**
Cost: 5 SP
Required: Inheritable

Your powers aren't just passed down through your family - they become a legacy. Your descendants inherit not just your abilities, but also your charisma, intelligence, and even your sense of purpose. They feel a deep sense of connection to you and your past and will carry on your legacy even after you're gone.  
  
Each generation’s inherent power is much greater than the previous, capable of inheriting a far more powerful version of their predecessor’s abilities. They will suffer no difficulty because of the increase in potency. You can also control whether they inherit a different expression of your abilities and what differences they possesses, as well as scale back anything they would inherit if you wish.  
  
But this isn't just a one-way street - as your family grows, so too does your power. Your abilities grow stronger with each new generation, and you can feel their presence like a comforting blanket, even in the afterlife.

**Humanity**
Cost: 10 CP
Incompatible:Inhumanity

No matter what powers you take, no matter what changes you undergo, you will remain human.  
  
Whether this means you are Mentally Human, Biologically Human, Spiritually Human, Fundamentally Human, or all of the above is up to you, but regardless of your choice, you will never lose the benefits, abilities, or physical might of any alternative race you picked.

**Worriless**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Parker Luck

Those you care about, such as your friends, family, and loved ones, are protected by fate. Similar to 'Plot' Armor, they're protected from negative or unfortunate circumstances, even when it comes to the supernatural. People are less likely to target them, and your enemies will prefer to use other methods of getting to you.

**Beneath Notice**
Cost: 4 SP
Cost: 4 CP

Beings that are two or more magnitudes of power above you won't notice you unless you are explicitly brought to their attention. Even if they were to somehow learn of you, the information would seem to be of little importance, causing their mind to unconsciously prioritize other subjects over you. This also protects against any passive effects they have that would affect you or protect against this perk.

**World Knowledge**
Cost: 5 SP

Upon entering a new universe, you will gain access to a comprehensive repository of knowledge pertaining to that world. This knowledge encompasses all relevant media, lore, and information, granting you an in-depth understanding of the intricacies and details of the world you are about to explore. This includes not only the official canon but also the insights and notes of the author(s) and/or creator(s), ensuring that you are well-equipped to navigate the world you are entering.

**Golden Perks**
Cost: 8 SP
Cost: 8 CP

Your Perks have evolved, making them an order of magnitude stronger. For example, if before, a Perk protected your mind from most of the attacks, it would now protect it from everything. Should a Perk not be able to go a tier higher, it would develop beneficial side effects that expand the scope of what it can do.

**I Don't Get It**
Cost: 1 SP

_Gaze your eyes, tune your ears._  
_Witness the snap of sanity, the scream of existence unraveling._  
_Feel it, hear it, understand... absolutely nothing._  
  
They say that looking upon an eldritch horror can make you mentally snap, and the void staring back will have you cease all brain functions... Well, you can safely say that's a load of crap. When you looked at Cthulhu, you just saw a bipedal squid; and when you looked into the void, you didn't see anything.

I Get It Now... But Not Really...?
Required: Invictus, or Well-Adjusted

Now, instead of being unbothered by everything because you are unable to comprehend it, now you are unbothered by everything because even though you get everything, you just simply don't get what about it bothers others.  
  
Sure, Cthulhu looks all scary, and its appearance is definitely a bit unique, and quite a bit impossible, however, you really don't get why that can be mind shattering.

**Naturalized Foreigner**
Cost: 5 SP

An odd situation normally comes up if you're not from a certain universe or were originally not from there—would certain universal concepts or restrictions apply to you?  
This perk settles that—now, you’re immune to any negative concepts and restrictions resulting from a setting’s interactions, rules, and metaphysics.  
Whereas taking the Psyker power may have made you vulnerable to the Warp corrupting or devouring your soul in the 40k universe—now, you’re treated as if you were utilizing your power in a foreign setting with no Warp, no soul, and no corruption, regardless of whether you possess a soul or not.  
  
If you went to the Nasuverse and Shiki Tohno's Mystic Eyes of Death Perception were used against you, their power would be ineffective, as you are not connected to the Root or to that setting’s concept of death.  
This only affects negative effects; positive ones are retained and applied as normal.  
Likewise, if a positive effect from one setting would no longer apply to you if you traveled to another, you can choose to retain it and apply it to yourself. You can toggle this on and off at will.  
You can also choose to apply this to other beings, items, specific power systems, or any other factors, allowing you to implant them with this ability when they cross worlds.  

Note: it doesn’t make you entirely immune to others' abilities—only to the negative effects that would not otherwise apply due to the setting’s rules.

**Continuity Of Existence**
Cost: 5 SP

Whether you are reborn as a clone, uploaded into a machine, pieced together by hands not your own, or even revived through a ritual better left unexamined, you will remain undeniably yourself. Your soul is never lost or severed in the process, always carrying with it your memories, personality, and all of your powers. What others might call a “copy” is no mere imitation—it is you in truth, seamless and unbroken, the same being in whatever form you inhabit.  
  
This ensures that any rebirth, reconstruction, or transference is a continuation rather than a replacement. There is no paradox, no dilution, no splintering of identity unless you wish it so. Even when others attempt to bring you back with imperfect methods, whether crude science or questionable sorcery, what they create will resonate with your essence and become a true vessel, ready to be filled wholly by you. In short: however many times you fall, however many ways you are brought back, you will always remain yourself.




### UPGRADES: 
**The Author didn't Forget** 
Cost: 10 SP 
Required:(Trump) As the Plot Demands
The Skills/Powers you receive are no longer temporary. 

**Favored by the Plot** 
Cost: 15 SP 
Required:(Trump) As the Plot Demands
The SP cap is raised to 20 SP and the Powers/Skills you receive will always come at the exact strength necessary to deal with the situation you wanted/needed them for as long as it doesn't exceed the SP cap.


### OTHER UPGRADES:

**Bypass**
Cost: 5 SP

What can affect organics but not inorganics can now affect both, what is weakened in the presence of living beings now isn't, what can't teleport something to inside something else now can, for your powers never gained the shackles called Manton Limit.

**New Target Acquired**
Cost: 7 SP

Your powers have what they can affect expanded; more specifically, if you have a power that can only affect others, it can now affect you and if you have a power that can only affect you, now it can affect others. Of course, those new targetings still use the same vectors as the original ones, so if you want to use Panacea on yourself, you would need to do something like touching your face with your hand.

*Unshackled*
Required:Bypass

What your powers can affect slowly expands to include similar things and may even develop new ways to interact with them, the stronger the new targets and interactions are the longer they take to come. As a example, (Master/Thinker) Confetti could gain the capacity to control paper itself, and later acquire the capacity to separate and meld paper, later would be able to increase the durability and sharpness of your paper.  
Use of yours powers will make those expansions come faster.

**Second Sight**
Cost: 7 SP

Any power that copies or creates powers will now give you the option to instead gain the power one Trigger Event higher. If you take this option, the newly developed power or power copied from someone who has only triggered once will work as if they were it was the Second Trigger version of that power. Any power copied from someone who has a Second Trigger could work as if the original user had gone through the hypothetical third trigger, and so on.  
  
Any power that goes through this second or third trigger will gain new features and upgraded potential at the cost of putting a heavier power strain on the shard that the power comes from. For example, removing a touch-based power's Manton Limit on touch while enforcing other of the power's aspects as a offset.

**Shard Automation**
Cost: 5 SP

Your power will now automatically catalogue any powers that come within a 100 meter radius of you, recording its blueprint.  
  
This will allow you to subconsciously know how you can replicate a power, its effects, and/or its principles using your own existing abilities, such as using a shaker power that could feasibly reproduce the effect of someone’s blaster power.  
In the event you possess a power that allows you to replicate and/or produce powers, it will give your power a mental blue print to build the power and its principles, allowing you to use it as a basis to start with, although the resources needed to make the power would have to be spent as normal. You can also use this to branch out into other expressions or possible powers.  
If your power allows you to replicate and/or copy a power, your power can now do so at will as it would as if they were present, even if they aren’t, using the mental blueprint in its stead.  
The range will begin at a minimum of 100 meters. But it also allows you to piggyback off the range and vectors of any powers you possess to enhance this, including powers that operate on line of sight or have a range greater than 100 meters, potentially extending it significantly.

*Catalogue*
Required:Archive

Your power now has an infinite [ARCHIVE] of every possible and potential power, component, combinations, fusions, variations, and expressions.  
  
This comes with a number of secondary thinker powers to manage this.  
The first is [PARSE], the ability to immediately parse through your archive to find exactly what you’re looking for, subconsciously aware of any possibilities and able to bring it up to the forefront for use.  
The second is [INTUIT], the ability to intuitively understand any blueprint, power, etc. on an instinctive level, as well as a perfecting your ability to replicate other powers/effects through your existing powers, becoming effortless and seamless.  
This allows you the ability to intuit every detail, quirk, and application of a power you either possess or come across, as well as its underlying nature and features, in addition to granting natural and effortless control over any power you possess or otherwise encounter.  
  
This also makes you an incredible teacher, capable of understanding any ability you encounter and helping them uncover new applications, as well as providing you insight into possible weaknesses against enemies.  
As before, this provides the blueprints and information needed to build powers/abilities for power creation power, it doesn’t reduce the cost of producing the power.

**Quality Over Quantity**
Cost: 10 SP

You now passively improve the density of all forms of energy you have access to, both internal and external. The higher the density, the more effective your energy is in the same quantity. By actively working to improve the density of your energies, you will eventually be able to increase the quality of the energy you are working on. Achieving an increase in quality is a momentous event, as a higher quality energy will be able to perform in an entirely different realm from the base form. Quality increases allow for more flexibility and creativity with the improved energy, loosening the bindings that you'd normally be subject to.

**AOE Manipulation**
Cost: 10 SP

Your area of effect (AOE) powers have become more malleable, allowing you to manipulate the shape of your AOEs. You can freely move an AOE's point of origin to another location, or even bind it to an object or being, causing the AOE to move when it's linked mass moves. Another facet of this increased malleability is the ability to diffuse or condense your AOEs in a tradeoff between strength and coverage. Keep in mind the tradeoff is in area, not distance, so if you want to make your 2x as big in every dimension, it would cost 8x the power. The maximum power that can gained from reducing area is capped at 64x, though you can reduce area further if you so desire.

**Power Stockpile**
Cost: 25 SP

You have a power stockpile that stockpiles the excess energy from your powers. Any time when a power isn't actively being used at 100%, it instead fills this stockpile with energy that can later be used to boost your other powers. Purely synergistic powers that don't do anything on their own don't give energy, as they don't have any mass excess that could be utilized. The excess energy gained from a power is proportional to both it's SP cost and how much of it is currently unused, and the same applies to the costs when boosting a power. This isn't perfectly efficient, causing you only to gain half as much energy as you should.  

**Creation vs. Destruction**
Cost: 15 SP

Powers come in various shapes and sizes, but the vast majority bottle down to two noticeable differences. Creation and Destruction. This upgrade forces you to choose between which one you’ll have an inherent affinity towards. Meaning if you select Creation, you’ll find all of your powers and abilities that align with it steadily increasing in arbitrary fields like potency, speed, and efficacy, with their advancement never stopping, eventually becoming virtually unrecognizable from their base counterparts. The inverse is also true if you would select destruction.  
This ability can partially work on certain powers, such as Divine Magic being empowered when smiting foes, but losing the bonus when creating barriers on allies.

**Automatic Defense**
Cost: 5 SP
Required: (Thinker) Danger Sense, or Sixth Sense

Your powers now operate much more smoothly, requiring almost no conscious effort on your part. Your danger sense is also much more refined, capable of intuiting a much greater deal of information, almost acting as form of clairvoyance.  
Your ability to anticipate danger is now tied directly to your reflexes and other powers, allowing your powers to act in your defense, even when you’re unaware, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated. They’ll automatically move your body out of the way such as activating your flight, teleporting you away, or even simply moving your body’s muscles reflexively to defend you.  
This will only happen should you under normal circumstances wish for it, allowing you to harm yourself if you wish, albeit it’ll automatically minimize it as much as possible to meet your need.

**Autonomous**
Cost: 5 SP
Required:Automatic Defense

All of your powers are now operating under a single premise: if you were to want it to happen, it will. You’ll never fail to activate your flight when you jump off a building, won’t accidentally drop your force field because you got distracted, never forget to return to human form before making your way through a small door, etc.  
The same goes for any constructs you may create with your power, with them now capable of acting as you would wish them to even when not aware. They’ll collect information if you normally would wish them to, they’ll fight an enemy if you would normally direct them to do so, etc. They’re capable of acting entirely autonomously, always acting in a manner that you would agree with.

**Natural**
Cost: 5 SP

You have an uncanny and natural aptitude for your abilities, as if the usage and talent was ingrained into your instincts.  
You possess absolute and perfect control and understanding over all your powers, granting instinctive mastery and knowledge over your powers, able to control your power in its every manifestation as effortlessly as breathing, from its most explosive and powerful manifestation to its most subtle nuances.

**Absolute Authority**
Cost: 30 SP

For one of your chosen powers that grants you control over some kind of domain, be it element, concept, or anything else, your connection to this domain becomes absolute, making you its sole embodiment and granting you absolute authority over it. If someone tries to manipulate your domain through any means, even if they possess perfect copies of your power, your authority will effortlessly supersede all their attempts to do so. Moreover, you are always aware of any such attempt and can block it if you so desire. You can limit the level of awareness so it does not become a constant distraction.  
  
As your existence is irreversibly tied to your chosen domain, your ability to manipulate it cannot be separated from you by any means. Even if the power that originally allowed you to control the domain is stolen, suppressed, or otherwise manipulated, it will not hinder you in the slightest, and the power itself will eventually be restored.  
  
Lastly, as you now embody your chosen domain, you will live as long as there is even the smallest trace of it in existence or even beyond it, constantly regenerating from the most grievous wounds or even complete obliteration. You also serve as an origin point, ensuring the endless generation of the element or concept constituting your domain in a self-perpetuating cycle.  
Note: this upgrade does not grant the mastery over domain by itself; as such, it will be useless without some other power. And your initial ability to wield it will still be tied to this power, although you will be able to effortlessly discover new and creative uses of your domain.

*White Hole*
Required:Endless Reserves

You can now generate an endless amount of your chosen element, as well as make infinite sources of it, like a never-extinguishing fire, an endless well of water, or an infinite source of mana for use by yourself or others.

*Artifactorio*
Required: Thinker/Master (Organized Mind), or Quantum Supremacy
Required: Thinker/Master (Autopilot), or Toposophic Emergence

You can now program portions of your element with an algorithm for a certain behaviour, which it will continuously execute even if you are not in range to actively influence it, as if you were controlling it manually, or even allow this programmed portion to receive commands, mental or otherwise, from other designated users.  
This will even allow you to create semi-conscious elementals, whose behaviour you can program in any way you want.

**Equilibrium**
Cost: 5 SP
*"A sound soul dwells within a sound mind and a sound body." * 
  
A common challenge for any aspiring hero, villain, warrior, or mage is that while they may possess a powerful body capable of withstanding or healing from any blow, curse, or injury, their soul remains vulnerable to attacks. Alternatively, your soul might be exceptionally resilient, able to ignore or heal from most damage, but a well-placed arrow to the neck could still kill you as easily as a regular human. Or perhaps you possess both a strong body and soul, yet your mind remains vulnerable to illusions or manipulation.  
  
But with you, your mind, body, and soul have achieved Equilibrium.  
  
Now, your regeneration, endurance, resistances, and even immortality (if you possess it) are perfectly balanced across all three aspects. If your body can regenerate a missing limb in seconds, your soul can repair any damage to itself just as quickly. Similarly, if you have a resilient soul that can resist or heal from harm, your body will respond in kind, regenerating or resisting damage just as effectively. Your mind, in turn, becomes more resistant to control and can swiftly recover from hostile telepathic attacks.  
  
For example, if your body is resistant to curses, poisons, or forces that erode it, your soul will be equally resistant to those that target it, and your mind will either ignore or rapidly fight off attempts at manipulation while recovering from attempts to destroy it.  
This state of Equilibrium does not grant you any new abilities on its own, but it ensures that any powers you already possess or acquire will apply equally to your body, mind, and soul.

**Ah, yes. My anti-[X] Technique. I haven't used this since the Heian Era.**
Cost: 10 SP

You have the uncanny ability to randomly "remember" a technique, spell, power, or unique expression of your power that happens to be the right ability to either counter or mitigate whatever negative thing you're going against.  
What this means is that if you were facing someone who is about to hit you with a massive attack, you may come up with a new way to use your powers that would allow you to block, redirect, or even nullify said attack. If someone is about to mind control you, then you might end up "remembering" that you had a special way of using your powers to protect your mind.  
This does not give you powers by itself, nor does it let you suddenly do things that you could not potentially do before. For example, if someone is shooting a fireball and you have magic, you might "remember" an anti-fire ward spell. But if you did not have magic, then you would not "remember" such an ability and would either have to dodge or hope you don’t burn.
