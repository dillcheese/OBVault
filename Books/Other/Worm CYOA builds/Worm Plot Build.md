# Base Build
**(Trump) As the Plot Demands**
Cost: 25 SP
Whenever you need or want it, you will spontaneously develop a Skill or Power at a level that, alone, would need a bit of effort in order to solve what you needed it for. Skills are capped at their possible limit while Powers are capped at 15 SP. Always remember that alone those Powers/Skills can only deal with your situation if you put effort into it. You need to defeat someone wielding a Gun? You can now take a couple shots, so better make it count in order to strike them down. Need to hit a moving target? Increased Marksmanship that just needs you to be completely focused in order to be 100% accurate. Those Powers/Skills are somewhat temporary but can stack with each other for greater effects. Essentially, there's three ways you can lose a Skill/Power: you solved what you gained them for, resulting in a 60% chance to lose them; you exited a conflict, with a 30% chance for each Skill/Power related to the situation; and finally, every 24 hours each of the Skills/Powers you gained have a 30% chance to disappear.

_Coddled by the Plot_
> Required: Ah, yes. My anti-[X] Technique. I haven't used this since the Heian Era. 

You now constantly acquire new Skills or Powers that have the exact strength necessary to solve their reason of existence—though still limited by the SP cap—but where before you needed to desire or need something for them to develop now merely existing is enough for your power to gift you Powers/Skills. You could go to lay in your bed and suddenly have the power to always be wearing comfortable cloths, or walk outside and not need sunscreen even in the most sunny days. These Skills/Powers are still bound to the three loss conditions.

### PERKS:

**Olympic**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Entity
Your muscles, natural regeneration, bone density, intelligence, perception, and senses are all just short of Parahuman.

**Rapid Learning**
Cost: 5 CP
Your ability to learn anything is greatly improved. You learn both theoretical and practical knowledge over 5 times faster than your base capability. This only affects you mentally, meaning while you can learn multiple martial arts, you may not be physically capable. This only works on mundane skills and your ability to use power effectively.
*Excellent Education*
Required:Teaching
Required:Learning
Your extensive knowledge of both learning and teaching has significantly enhanced your own learning ability. You now learn 15 times faster, and those you teach experience improvements as if they had the 'Rapid Learning' perk and 'Learning' skill.

**Frankenstein**
Cost: 10 CP
Incompatible:Entity
You're a low-level Brute in durability, strength, and regeneration. A low-level Thinker in reflexes, reaction time, and senses. And finally, a low-level Mover in speed. You are resistant to Master effects and predictions about you are often slightly off. Thinker powers that sense your mind won't work properly.
*Unity of Mind and Body*
Required: Olympic, or Rapid Learning
Your mind now matches your body. You are a low-level Thinker, with enhanced cognitive capabilities that elevate your learning speed, memory, and analytical skills far beyond human limits. You can acquire and master new skills at a parahuman level, learning in weeks what would take others years. Additionally, your enhanced mind and body work in concert. When engaged in high-pressure situations, your mind shifts into tactical overdrive, allowing you to analyze threats, predict likely outcomes, and make optimal decisions in real time.

**Blank**
Cost: 5 SP
Cost: 10 CP
You become a blind spot for Thinkers.

Powers that predict the future cannot account for your actions; clairvoyants that peer into the past or watch over the present cannot search for you; people trying to conjure up information about you using only their power would find nothing.
Some powers will register your presence if their host can perceive you with their senses but they will be unable to gain further information, Gallant would be unable to sense your emotions, danger-sense would not warn their user of your actions, but they'd register your presence and show a neutral state.

This does not, however, stop someone from noticing that the future they were expecting has changed or the result and ripple effects of your actions altogether. It does not block direct observation either — in person or via technological means — and does not prevent a Thinker from building a model using this information.
Powers that work primarily through their user's senses can draw their own conclusions unimpeded. For example, if Tattletale sees you visibly getting upset at something she said, she would be able to tell that what she said had a negative effect on you.
You can, at will, allow selected thinker powers to perceive you and can rescind this allowance at will at any time.


**Mental Barrier**
Cost: 5 SP
Cost: 5 CP

You become immune to powers that directly affect your mind, emotions, or senses. This also protects against perception filters, hypnotic tinker-tech, body control or possession, and all forms of memetic hazards.  
However, physical effects like drugs, pheromones, or parasites will still affect you. Tinker-tech drugs or viruses will have their effects reduced but not completely negated.  
This protection adapts to the form you take. If you are a mechanical or digital life form, the protection would extend to cover viruses, hacking, and other forms of subversion or reprogramming.  
With your permission, you can allow powers to influence you.

*Blood-Brain Barrier*
Required:Frankenstein

You also gain immunity to physical effects like drugs, pheromones, and parasites.

**Trumped the Trump**
Cost: 5 SP
Incompatible:No Powers

Any powers and internal power supplies you possess cannot be drained, suppressed, weakened, stolen, copied, altered, controlled, reproduced, or otherwise manipulated against your will. Unless you will it to be otherwise, Trump powers do not work on you. You could even block certain aspects of powers influencing you, either yours or theirs. Such as being given a power and not being Mastered through it. You can be Mastered into consenting to a Trump working on you if you haven’t selected Mental Barrier, though.  
Paragon powers can Trump this immunity under certain circumstances (specified in the power's description).

**Powered Sustenance**
Cost: 2 SP
Incompatible:No Powers
Incompatible:Entity

You no longer need to eat, drink water, breathe, or exercise as your Shard or Power will sustain your body for as long as it has [Energy].

**Who Wants to Live Forever?**
Cost: 2 SP
Incompatible:No Powers

Your ability to age can be altered whenever you want. You can make yourself younger or older whenever you want. You can also fake age as if you were growing up normally, although you wouldn't suffer the normal effects of old age.  
This doesn't increase toughness or physical ability aside from protecting you from the frailty of age.

**Immortality Failsafe**
Cost: 3 CP

This perk eliminates any issues that may arise from an infinite, or just extremely long, lifespan. You can experience everything the world has to offer, visit every place, meet every type of person, learn every skill, and then do it all over again, each time feeling just as fresh and new as the first if you so desire.  
This does not affect your personality, only making sure that you'll never be susceptible to boredom, ennui, and listlessness unless you wish for it.

**All-Seeing Precognition**
Cost: 10 SP
Incompatible:No Powers

Blindspot? Hah! Your powers have no blindspots. They can see Eidolon, The Endbringers, The Entity, Mantellum, and all other blind spots.  
Your power does have one blindspot, anyway... it cannot see those with the Blank perk.

**Only A Sith Deals in Absolutes**
Cost: 5 SP
Incompatible:No Powers

What happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object, which wins? The answer is now simple, which one do you want to win?  
Now when powers of an absolute nature clash, you choose which wins, whether yours or another’s. You may also choose to have it switched at any time or have the effects simply cancel each other.  
This also allows you to enforce any of your powers, perks, and other effects as absolutes even if they wouldn’t be otherwise. This can be turned on and off.

**Noctis Cape**
Cost: 3 SP
Incompatible:Entity

You have no need to sleep, you'll constantly be alert and awake. You also have an infinite and perfectly eidetic memory, capable of perfectly recalling anything that has happened to you since you received your powers. Any memories prior to your trigger are remembered as well as you could recall them when you triggered.
*Savant*
Required:Frankenstein
Required: Olympic, or Rapid Learning

Your mind automatically stores and processes any and all information your senses encounter, even if for but a moment. If new information provides context for one you already possessed, it automatically forms logic links. This allows you to grasp complex topics after skimming through a book without requiring any additional time to comprehend its contents.

**Fan Service**
Cost: 10 CP
Incompatible:Entity

Now, calling you beautiful or handsome would be a massive understatement. While you are still recognisably you, your appearance has been overhauled to become an idealised version of yourself. The magnitude of this enhancement can be anywhere from being more attractive than a supermodel to making a goddess of beauty jealous.  
  
Nothing can ever tarnish your looks. Unless you desire otherwise, any wounds you receive will heal perfectly and not leave any scars, you will not gain weight, visible muscle mass, body hair, or retain any other unwanted physical changes that can be healed, etc. Even sick and injured, you will look magnificent.

*Siren's Voice*
Required:Master (Hypnotist)
Required:Taming
Required:Shaker/Master (Speaker)
Required:Present Perfect

Before, you would have turned heads, and now you can become the center of attention if you wish, as you know how to make the most of what you have to influence others. Your instinctual control over all aspects of your actions allows you to tailor your behavior to work in the best way on those around you, whether they are normal people, animals, or even supernatural beings, with your voice standing out the most. Your voice is like molten chocolate in the ears of others—so beautiful that it can bring out the best in people and stop conflicts between them with just a few words.  
  
Your ability to influence animals and implant ideas into people has merged into this, making it even more powerful. You know how to make someone fall under your spell within moments of meeting them, implanting ideas into all living creatures. Even the smallest things, like a whistle or a hand gesture, can activate them as sleeper agents, with your voice alone being able to greatly influence both people and animals.  

Aside from controlling others, this is also effective in conveying complex signals, allowing others to pick up on the general idea of the message or helping you build a successful career in show business, where people can't get enough of you.  
Most would mistake you for a Parahuman or even someone blessed by Aphrodite.

**Smouldering**
Cost: 5 CP

You will always experience dramatic moments where you _smoulder_—whether it's while admiring a breathtaking sunset or locking eyes with a formidable opponent. These moments also include simple poses made to highlight your good side. These intense, captivating moments are never unnoticed; there will always be someone nearby to witness and appreciate your presence.

*Magnetic Presence*
Required:Dramatics
You possess a dramatic flair that ensures you are always the center of attention. Everything you do, whether intentional or not, draws the eyes and ears of those around you. Your presence is naturally magnetic, effortlessly capturing the attention of any audience. This manifests through both verbal and non-verbal cues, from the way you speak to your gestures and even your silences. You exude an aura that can be felt by everyone, making you impossible to ignore. This flair allows you to navigate any situation with a natural gravitas, ensuring that you leave a lasting impression on everyone you encounter.  
You can turn this on or off at will.

**Adorable**
Cost: 5 CP

You are Adorable. No matter what you do or say, people will find you completely adorable. You can be covered in blood and people will still find you too cute to resist, if a bit creepy. This affects your subconscious actions and both conscious actions and physical appearance to a limited degree. You can toggle this Perk on and off.

**Peaceful Vibes**
Cost: 2 CP
Incompatible:Personality Conflict

People with the same goals, principles, or personality are more likely to mesh well together. Even if they were your enemies yesterday, you find it easier to befriend and work with them. Yesterday's enemies can be today's friends, against a common foe the both of you somehow work wonderfully together.  
It's easier for people to set aside their differences and work together. You'll be more likely to work well together on a team. This even makes actions like Tinkering together easier.

**Invictus**
Cost: 10 CP

Your will is absolute, boundless, and unbreakable. Maybe it’s your ideals, an all-consuming ambition, or maybe it's just a rock-solid certainty in how you see the world. You are patient beyond belief, even capable of spending countless hours doing mind-numbing tasks. Your willpower is endless and no matter how difficult the situation, even if you're torn in half, locked in a time loop of endless agony for thousands of years, or subjected to a fate worse than death, you'll be able to shrug it off. You will never be left drifting without a sense of purpose, and though you might change your goals and refine your ideals you always have the motivation to fuel turning them into a reality.  
  
This will greatly bolster your sense of self in the face of adversity, and you’ll be able to plant your feet when everyone else is giving up. Of course, you still have emotions and you can still be hurt emotionally, but you'll always be able to maintain your composure and keep your emotions from ruling your decision-making. Take care that you don't become so tunnel-visioned that you fail to see others as actual people with agency.

**Well-Adjusted**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Cold Heart

You won't lose your sanity or rationality under any circumstances unless you're being controlled by a power. And even if you somehow did, no matter the circumstances, you will never lose your humanity and empathy. Your team, family, or friends will always be there to bring you back from the abyss. Your personal issues are much easier to work through and even without help you'll be able to get through them in time. This might take a while if it's bad, but you'll make it out eventually.  
  
This also makes you highly resistant to mental health problems and emotional manipulation, though not completely immune. You’re also really good at helping others through their issues, and it’ll stick more often than not as long as you can get through to them.

**Patience of a Saint**
Cost: 4 CP

Your patience is inexhaustible. You could sit without moving for days with no problem, or easily spend countless hours on a single, mind-numbing task.

**Reputable**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Disreputable

You gain a reputation easily, a spark of appearance that makes you shine. Your accomplishments are often embellished by others or people just credit things happening to you. Anything you do will be amazing and astounding. Even in losing, you seem to lose gracefully and in winning you seem like an unsurmountable giant. The impression you give can change depending on how you want, you could be cool or cute, handsome or beautiful. The way you move, talk, and fight will always be astonishing, even if you didn't intend to.  
This makes it easier to bluff your way out of a situation and gives you leverage in getting what you want. This can be toggled on and off.

**'Plot' Armor**
Cost: 5 CP

You're not unlucky. You won't get killed by accident, only by something someone did intentionally. Someone has to go out of their way to kill you if they want you dead. This power doesn't protect you from Endbringers (or any other truly overpowered or world-ending threats).

**Just as Planned**
Cost: 10 CP

The fate or "canon" of this world is molded by those much higher than yourself, and unless intentionally acted against, shall follow the same path. Unless you involve yourself directly in the events foretold by Wildbow, everything shall follow the path he laid out more or less.  
Arriving on a Crossover or an Alternate Earth will also ensure that they'll follow the path laid out by their respective author(s) unless you directly involve yourself.

**Manton Protected**
Cost: 5 SP
Cost: 10 CP

The inside of your body is protected against influences that attempt to target it. For example, a telekinetic cannot crush your heart inside of your chest.  
You also gain some measure of resistance to esoteric attacks like instant death or erasure. This is not complete immunity and will still hurt you, severely, but you will at least have a chance to survive.

**Ripple Effect Proof Memory**
Cost: 10 SP

When the timeline changes and you suddenly gain a new history, you remember both the new timeline _and_ the old timeline, with the memories helpfully ‘separated’ so you don’t get them confused while, optionally, still experiencing the full emotional impact. This works whether the new timeline is caused by a ‘Groundhog Day’ style timeloop, a Save and Load system, a time machine, a wish that rewrites history, or something weirder.  
  
If you want, you can choose to emotionally distance yourself from the memories of the old timeline (such as if in the old timeline you got tortured by Skynet or something) or the new timeline (such as if you got ~~kidnapped~~ **adopted** by your nemesis as a kid and then ~~abused~~ **trained** to become a loyal enforcer), making them as impactful as a story you read instead of something you experienced firsthand, and if needed can reverse this at will.  
  
**Note**: This doesn’t do a thing if someone just mind controls you into believing that something happened in the past, such as you being their childhood friend, it's only if history actually changes. If you want immunity to that, get _Mental Barrier_ or something.

*Ripple Effect Proof Body*
Required:Manton Protected

Your resistance to supernatural attempts to influence has gained a new dimension, allowing you to resist time travel-based alterations. Now, if someone changes the past in such a way that your body is altered, you can reject the change. For example, if the new timeline resulted in you losing an eye, you can choose to reject that change and regain your binocular vision. Like before, bring the change back if needed.  
  
This has a limit, though; the more powerful the being / force that created this new timeline is, the less you can resist the changes. If the person who did it is weaker or as strong as you, you can reject the physical changes just fine. If they are more than double but less than an order of magnitude stronger than you, you can reject crippling changes like a missing limb or a slave seal tattoo, but cosmetic changes like a new haircut or mundane tattoos can’t be rejected. If they are more than a hundred times stronger than you, then lethal changes can be rejected, but crippling changes like loss of limbs can’t be. If they are more than a thousand times stronger than you, just accept your fate.  
  
If you have _**Golden Perks**_ as well, you can reject _any_ retroactive changes to your body, no matter how much stronger the source is compared to you.  
  
**Note**: This only works with time travel or other retroactive reality shifts. If someone just uses their power to change your hair color or something without altering the past (and Manton Protected didn’t already stop it), you can’t use this to reverse it.

**Homecoming**
Cost: 5 SP

Any teleportation or similar power you possess now allows you to travel to other universes. You can travel to any universe you have previously been to, including your home universe, as well as target universes based on any knowledge you possess, such as memories you had prior to gaining powers, awareness of a setting through some form of media, etc.  
If you have no such ability, you can still travel to other worlds by accessing the medium in which it is depicted. For example, a Harry Potter book for the Harry Potter universe, a Skyrim game for Skyrim, etc.

**Resume**
Cost: 15 SP

If you possess any means to travel across the multiverse, you can choose to re-enter any universe you have previously been to at the exact same time you left it, no matter how much time has passed. This includes your original world.  
If you have any powers that allow you to interact with other universes without actually moving to them, they will count as if you were there when used.

**Holding Back**
Cost: 5 SP

Every single aspect of your powers, strength, and perks can be selectively toggled and dialed to the point they can be turned completely off. You can also select people and individuals who are not affected by your perks and powers, making it seem as if they're capable of withstanding reality-breaking attacks. You can scale your reality-ending destruction to be tuned down to cause mild concussions, granting you the ability to not overkill everything in existence. As long as you wish it, it’s almost impossible to kill someone if you don't want to.  
This does not work on drawbacks or on perks that rely on items like Wealthy.

**Hidden Strength**
Cost: 3 SP

Now you can selectively conceal your true capabilities. When doing so, no device or ability will be able to detect your hidden powers.  
You can either conceal any or all of your powers and skills completely, appearing as if you never possessed them in the first place, hide only one some aspects of those, or, alternatively, just limit the detectable level of strength, appearing weaker than you truly are.

*Red Herring*
Required:Explained
You now have control over how others interpret the nature of any and all of your powers and abilities. For example, you can disguise any of your powers so that they appear to belong to a completely different power system, such as masking your magic powers as psionics and vice versa. This is so powerful that even if the nature of powers may be revealed through something like a blood test, everyone will still come to the conclusion that your powers are exactly what you present as.  
  
While not granting you any direct buffs, as the nature of your powers doesn't truly change, if something in the world is conditioned upon you having the right nature of power, you can appear as if you satisfy any such requirement.

**Accentuate the Positive**
Cost: 8 SP
Cost: 8 CP

You are now immune to the negative side effects of power sources from outside yourself, whether it be combat drugs, enchantments, items, divine blessings, curses, and anything that empowers you or that you wield in some manner.  
  
This means that if a drug could enhance your strength tenfold but reduced your life by half, you could take it as you please with no worry for the cost as it doesn’t impact you.  
  
Likewise, if an item granted you the power to see the future at the cost of inevitable madness, feel free to use it as you please as your mind remains as sharp and crystal clear decades after, as before you even touched the item.  
  
Made a pact with a demon for the ability to manipulate light, the cost being your soul, weakness to holy objects, and an inability to use your powers or even walk on holy ground? Walk into a church, pray, utilize your light to create an interesting spectacle for the parishioners, and fret not for your soul is still your own.  
  
This also comes with complete immunity to addiction.  
The perk doesn’t expand upon the power, nor does it add new abilities; it merely removes the complications that may arise from the power.  
This allows you to benefit from all the positives of outside power sources, with any negative mechanics and complications wiped away or shifted to be non-detrimental, such as a demonic force’s natural weakness and aversion to holy objects. However, it would not add new aspects; it removes negative effects and factors, but doesn’t create new beneficial ones.

**Eliminate the Negative**
Cost: 12 SP
Cost: 12 CP

You are now immune to the negative side effects of your self-derived powers.  
  
For example, magic that may have used your emotions and/or stamina to fuel its power now has a separate pool to draw upon so as to not leech off you.  
  
Likewise, any aspect of your abilities that negatively affects your mental state, your body, your soul, or any other aspect of yourself is wiped away or shifted to a non-detriment.  
  
Are you a Kryptonian weak to Green Kryptonite? Now chuck that useless rock as if it was some common quartz rock. Let those grunts think they have a chance because they’ve got their magic bullet only to laugh in their face as that bullet does nothing.  

Your magic leaves you barely able to stand, fog your mind, or scar your soul? Not anymore. Fire as many spells as you wish—your health, body, mind, and soul remains unfazed. Your magic instead drains from a separate pool that replenishes over time.  
Your bloodline grants you the power to enter a form that gives phenomenal cosmic power in exchange for giving up your humanity? Feel free to shift back and forth as you wish. Enjoy the benefits of remaining who you were with all the pleasure of having all that power.  
  
The perk doesn’t expand upon the power, nor does it add new abilities; it merely removes the complications that may arise from the power.  
This allows you to benefit from all the positives of your powers. Any drawbacks, powers, biological traits, or magic systems that may have held any negative complication or mechanics have been wiped away or shifted to be non-detrimental. However, it would not add new aspects; it removes negative effects and factors but doesn’t create new beneficial ones.  
It would remove a Kryptonian's natural weakness to Green Kryptonite, but not their dependence on sunlight, nor would it grant new abilities for perceived limitations.

**Platinum Kryptonite**
Cost: 5 SP
Cost: 5 CP
Required:Accentuate the Positive
Required:Eliminate the Negative

Alongside eliminating any drawbacks your powers come with, you can turn them into strengths.  
  
Whenever you encounter an effect that would naturally weaken or debilitate you as a result of the powers you possess, you are instead enhanced by the same margin.  
  
For example, as a Kryptonian, Green Kryptonite would amplify your power, pushing you as far away in strength from your normal form as you are to humans.  
  
This applies automatically; however, you can choose for it to not take effect if you wish, for any reason.

**Comic Book Physics**
Cost: 5 SP
Cost: 5 CP

In some universes, certain champions of justice travel through the atmosphere at superluminal speeds without igniting everything for miles and lift buildings, even though they should crumble due to structural integrity. Now, so can you.  
  
Not only do you have any required secondary powers that your primary powers might require to be used without horrifying or destructive implications, but, provided you have the powers for it, you can lift buildings without them falling apart and move at speeds in the multiple digits without destroying everything if you don't want to.  
  
You now have complete control over the amount of collateral damage your attacks can output such that a planet-busting punch will only affect your enemy, not the planet itself. It all just works.

**Friendly**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Personality Conflict
Incompatible:Lonely

You find it easier to make friends, and the friends you do make are in it for the long run.

*Joys of Friendship, Passion of Rivalry*
Required:Communication
Required:Connection

Some people might think you're the child of a Shounen Hero and a Magical Girl, given how easily you can form and maintain so many friendships at once. These bonds are genuine and deep, and they begin to have a positive impact on those you connect with.  
  
As a result, they become better at communicating their feelings and intentions to others. Having someone with whom they can speak frankly allows them to grow in ways they might not have been able to if they were alone. Gaining the encouragement to take risks or stand up for themselves are just a few examples of how you and your friendships uplift each other, making each of you better than before.  
This improvement can also be seen in rivals. At first, it may seem like you and they are only getting better at defeating each other and others, but as time goes on, both you and they find other aspects of your lives improving thanks to having someone to compete against. Even something as simple and complex as ideals is refined through this conflict between you.  
For you, friendship almost seems like a power in itself. Though, no giant friendship lasers included—you'll have to look elsewhere for that.

**A Significant Other**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Lonely

Through a stroke of fate, you either have or will soon find your soulmate. Maybe you’ve yet to meet them, or maybe—if you are a reincarnation—you already have prior history together; every single detail is completely up to you. You can leave this entirely to chance, or you may optionally choose now whom this may be, anyone of your choice. Either way, when you next cross paths, you’ll both immediately and unmistakably know that you’re meant for each other.  
  
They are matched to your ideal in every way, and you are the same for them. Whether it’s a romantic interest, a friendship, or anything else—you're perfect for each other. You get along easily and flawlessly, your bond is unbreakable, you're both willing to go to hell and back for one another and support each other to be the best versions of yourselves, and every bit of love is reciprocated. All you need is each other, and even if that’s all you had, it would still be the happiest time of your life.  
  
If you genuinely want this level of relationship or to develop one with someone in the future, you’ll find that things will very quickly and organically progress to this level.


**Peaceful Life**
Cost: 10 CP
Incompatible:Always on The Clock

With all those troubles that come with a super life, you can never have enough "me time". This Perk helps you by letting all your troubles take a "day off". An eldritch monster is trying to devour reality, and you are the only one who can stop it? Relax, it won't happen until you have your "free day".  
  
A super tinker is planning to take over the world? Relax, that won't happen when you are playing your games, having a date, or even on the beach. This perk takes action from time to time while you are relaxing or too stressed.

**World Clean**
Cost: 2 SP

Your body will be completely self-cleaning. The moment you close your eyes, and wish to be clean, any filth, dirt, and grime built up on your body and or your clothing will magically disappear, this also includes your dental hygiene. Not only that, but you'll also carry a wonderful scent, perfectly tailored to the liking of yourself and those around you, such that everyone smells you a little different, but loves it all the same. You'll both smell, feel, and be heavenly fresh forevermore.

**Power Tweak (All)**
Cost: 10 SP

You can change how any aspects of any of your powers, objects of powers, or perks work. This doesn't make it more powerful but can change some of its mechanics.  
  
You can use this to alter the mechanics of some of your powers or OoPs, a single one of them, fuse all of them or allow them to be expressed through one power or object, or any combination of alterations you can think of. This doesn’t allow you to make yourself more powerful on its own.

**Tailor Made**
Cost: 2 SP
Required: Power Tweak (All)

Your powers, OoPs, and perks are all adjusted to fit you perfectly. The little nuances and the subtle details that you may have otherwise overlooked or miscalculated are no longer an issue, instead all the little nuances and details are smoothed out entirely on their own to become the best possible fit for you.

*Personal Touch*
Required: Thematic
Your powers, objects of powers, and perks aren’t just fixed in at one point in time; instead, they’ll alter and shift to continuously match you perfectly.  
This also allows you to manually make adjustments at will, freely shifting it to suit your needs. If you prefer, you can always allow it to default back to shifting into an optimal state for you once more.

**Serendipitous Luck**
Cost: 3 CP

The universe conspires in your favor, no matter what you seek to achieve or overcome. Good luck follows you at every turn, increasing the likelihood of success and decreasing the likelihood of failure in all your endeavors, no matter how challenging they may be. Luck smiles upon you always. This might not help you win the lottery, or find your soulmate but it can be felt in almost every aspect of your life.

**Sixth Sense**
Cost: 2 SP

You possess an innate ability to perceive and anticipate danger or hidden information.

**Inner Harmony**
Cost: 4 CP

You have attained inner peace and balance, allowing you to remain calm and centered in any situation.

**Charismatic Aura**
Cost: 3 CP

You radiate charisma and magnetic charm, effortlessly drawing others towards you and influencing them positively.

**Inheritable**
Cost: 5 SP
Incompatible: No Powers

Your powers, perks, and skills can be passed down to your descendants, and to adopted children who have been in your care for at least 5 years, or not in any combination of your choice.  
  
Taking this with reincarnation will allow you to retroactively add any of your powers, perks, and skills to any family members or loved ones in your new life in any combination of your choice. You can choose for their versions to be weaker than your own, or with certain weaknesses, or to manifest different expressions of power.  
  
You can apply this to any ancestors you may have as if you inherited it from them instead of the other way around.

**Heir to the Throne**
Cost: 5 SP
Required: Inheritable

Your powers aren't just passed down through your family - they become a legacy. Your descendants inherit not just your abilities, but also your charisma, intelligence, and even your sense of purpose. They feel a deep sense of connection to you and your past and will carry on your legacy even after you're gone.  
  
Each generation’s inherent power is much greater than the previous, capable of inheriting a far more powerful version of their predecessor’s abilities. They will suffer no difficulty because of the increase in potency. You can also control whether they inherit a different expression of your abilities and what differences they possesses, as well as scale back anything they would inherit if you wish.  
  
But this isn't just a one-way street - as your family grows, so too does your power. Your abilities grow stronger with each new generation, and you can feel their presence like a comforting blanket, even in the afterlife.

**Humanity**
Cost: 10 CP
Incompatible:Inhumanity

No matter what powers you take, no matter what changes you undergo, you will remain human.  
  
Whether this means you are Mentally Human, Biologically Human, Spiritually Human, Fundamentally Human, or all of the above is up to you, but regardless of your choice, you will never lose the benefits, abilities, or physical might of any alternative race you picked.

**Worriless**
Cost: 5 CP
Incompatible:Parker Luck

Those you care about, such as your friends, family, and loved ones, are protected by fate. Similar to 'Plot' Armor, they're protected from negative or unfortunate circumstances, even when it comes to the supernatural. People are less likely to target them, and your enemies will prefer to use other methods of getting to you.

**Beneath Notice**
Cost: 4 SP
Cost: 4 CP

Beings that are two or more magnitudes of power above you won't notice you unless you are explicitly brought to their attention. Even if they were to somehow learn of you, the information would seem to be of little importance, causing their mind to unconsciously prioritize other subjects over you. This also protects against any passive effects they have that would affect you or protect against this perk.

**World Knowledge**
Cost: 5 SP

Upon entering a new universe, you will gain access to a comprehensive repository of knowledge pertaining to that world. This knowledge encompasses all relevant media, lore, and information, granting you an in-depth understanding of the intricacies and details of the world you are about to explore. This includes not only the official canon but also the insights and notes of the author(s) and/or creator(s), ensuring that you are well-equipped to navigate the world you are entering.

**Golden Perks**
Cost: 8 SP
Cost: 8 CP

Your Perks have evolved, making them an order of magnitude stronger. For example, if before, a Perk protected your mind from most of the attacks, it would now protect it from everything. Should a Perk not be able to go a tier higher, it would develop beneficial side effects that expand the scope of what it can do.

**I Don't Get It**
Cost: 1 SP

_Gaze your eyes, tune your ears._  
_Witness the snap of sanity, the scream of existence unraveling._  
_Feel it, hear it, understand... absolutely nothing._  
  
They say that looking upon an eldritch horror can make you mentally snap, and the void staring back will have you cease all brain functions... Well, you can safely say that's a load of crap. When you looked at Cthulhu, you just saw a bipedal squid; and when you looked into the void, you didn't see anything.

I Get It Now... But Not Really...?
Required: Invictus, or Well-Adjusted

Now, instead of being unbothered by everything because you are unable to comprehend it, now you are unbothered by everything because even though you get everything, you just simply don't get what about it bothers others.  
  
Sure, Cthulhu looks all scary, and its appearance is definitely a bit unique, and quite a bit impossible, however, you really don't get why that can be mind shattering.

**Naturalized Foreigner**
Cost: 5 SP

An odd situation normally comes up if you're not from a certain universe or were originally not from there—would certain universal concepts or restrictions apply to you?  
This perk settles that—now, you’re immune to any negative concepts and restrictions resulting from a setting’s interactions, rules, and metaphysics.  
Whereas taking the Psyker power may have made you vulnerable to the Warp corrupting or devouring your soul in the 40k universe—now, you’re treated as if you were utilizing your power in a foreign setting with no Warp, no soul, and no corruption, regardless of whether you possess a soul or not.  
  
If you went to the Nasuverse and Shiki Tohno's Mystic Eyes of Death Perception were used against you, their power would be ineffective, as you are not connected to the Root or to that setting’s concept of death.  
This only affects negative effects; positive ones are retained and applied as normal.  
Likewise, if a positive effect from one setting would no longer apply to you if you traveled to another, you can choose to retain it and apply it to yourself. You can toggle this on and off at will.  
You can also choose to apply this to other beings, items, specific power systems, or any other factors, allowing you to implant them with this ability when they cross worlds.  

Note: it doesn’t make you entirely immune to others' abilities—only to the negative effects that would not otherwise apply due to the setting’s rules.

**Continuity Of Existence**
Cost: 5 SP

Whether you are reborn as a clone, uploaded into a machine, pieced together by hands not your own, or even revived through a ritual better left unexamined, you will remain undeniably yourself. Your soul is never lost or severed in the process, always carrying with it your memories, personality, and all of your powers. What others might call a “copy” is no mere imitation—it is you in truth, seamless and unbroken, the same being in whatever form you inhabit.  
  
This ensures that any rebirth, reconstruction, or transference is a continuation rather than a replacement. There is no paradox, no dilution, no splintering of identity unless you wish it so. Even when others attempt to bring you back with imperfect methods, whether crude science or questionable sorcery, what they create will resonate with your essence and become a true vessel, ready to be filled wholly by you. In short: however many times you fall, however many ways you are brought back, you will always remain yourself.


### UPGRADES: 
**The Author didn't Forget** 
Cost: 10 SP 
Required:(Trump) As the Plot Demands
The Skills/Powers you receive are no longer temporary. 

**Favored by the Plot** 
Cost: 15 SP 
Required:(Trump) As the Plot Demands
The SP cap is raised to 20 SP and the Powers/Skills you receive will always come at the exact strength necessary to deal with the situation you wanted/needed them for as long as it doesn't exceed the SP cap.


### OTHER UPGRADES:

**Bypass**
Cost: 5 SP

What can affect organics but not inorganics can now affect both, what is weakened in the presence of living beings now isn't, what can't teleport something to inside something else now can, for your powers never gained the shackles called Manton Limit.

**New Target Acquired**
Cost: 7 SP

Your powers have what they can affect expanded; more specifically, if you have a power that can only affect others, it can now affect you and if you have a power that can only affect you, now it can affect others. Of course, those new targetings still use the same vectors as the original ones, so if you want to use Panacea on yourself, you would need to do something like touching your face with your hand.

*Unshackled*
Required:Bypass

What your powers can affect slowly expands to include similar things and may even develop new ways to interact with them, the stronger the new targets and interactions are the longer they take to come. As a example, (Master/Thinker) Confetti could gain the capacity to control paper itself, and later acquire the capacity to separate and meld paper, later would be able to increase the durability and sharpness of your paper.  
Use of yours powers will make those expansions come faster.

**Second Sight**
Cost: 7 SP

Any power that copies or creates powers will now give you the option to instead gain the power one Trigger Event higher. If you take this option, the newly developed power or power copied from someone who has only triggered once will work as if they were it was the Second Trigger version of that power. Any power copied from someone who has a Second Trigger could work as if the original user had gone through the hypothetical third trigger, and so on.  
  
Any power that goes through this second or third trigger will gain new features and upgraded potential at the cost of putting a heavier power strain on the shard that the power comes from. For example, removing a touch-based power's Manton Limit on touch while enforcing other of the power's aspects as a offset.

**Shard Automation**
Cost: 5 SP

Your power will now automatically catalogue any powers that come within a 100 meter radius of you, recording its blueprint.  
  
This will allow you to subconsciously know how you can replicate a power, its effects, and/or its principles using your own existing abilities, such as using a shaker power that could feasibly reproduce the effect of someone’s blaster power.  
In the event you possess a power that allows you to replicate and/or produce powers, it will give your power a mental blue print to build the power and its principles, allowing you to use it as a basis to start with, although the resources needed to make the power would have to be spent as normal. You can also use this to branch out into other expressions or possible powers.  
If your power allows you to replicate and/or copy a power, your power can now do so at will as it would as if they were present, even if they aren’t, using the mental blueprint in its stead.  
The range will begin at a minimum of 100 meters. But it also allows you to piggyback off the range and vectors of any powers you possess to enhance this, including powers that operate on line of sight or have a range greater than 100 meters, potentially extending it significantly.

*Catalogue*
Required:Archive

Your power now has an infinite [ARCHIVE] of every possible and potential power, component, combinations, fusions, variations, and expressions.  
  
This comes with a number of secondary thinker powers to manage this.  
The first is [PARSE], the ability to immediately parse through your archive to find exactly what you’re looking for, subconsciously aware of any possibilities and able to bring it up to the forefront for use.  
The second is [INTUIT], the ability to intuitively understand any blueprint, power, etc. on an instinctive level, as well as a perfecting your ability to replicate other powers/effects through your existing powers, becoming effortless and seamless.  
This allows you the ability to intuit every detail, quirk, and application of a power you either possess or come across, as well as its underlying nature and features, in addition to granting natural and effortless control over any power you possess or otherwise encounter.  
  
This also makes you an incredible teacher, capable of understanding any ability you encounter and helping them uncover new applications, as well as providing you insight into possible weaknesses against enemies.  
As before, this provides the blueprints and information needed to build powers/abilities for power creation power, it doesn’t reduce the cost of producing the power.

**Quality Over Quantity**
Cost: 10 SP

You now passively improve the density of all forms of energy you have access to, both internal and external. The higher the density, the more effective your energy is in the same quantity. By actively working to improve the density of your energies, you will eventually be able to increase the quality of the energy you are working on. Achieving an increase in quality is a momentous event, as a higher quality energy will be able to perform in an entirely different realm from the base form. Quality increases allow for more flexibility and creativity with the improved energy, loosening the bindings that you'd normally be subject to.

**AOE Manipulation**
Cost: 10 SP

Your area of effect (AOE) powers have become more malleable, allowing you to manipulate the shape of your AOEs. You can freely move an AOE's point of origin to another location, or even bind it to an object or being, causing the AOE to move when it's linked mass moves. Another facet of this increased malleability is the ability to diffuse or condense your AOEs in a tradeoff between strength and coverage. Keep in mind the tradeoff is in area, not distance, so if you want to make your 2x as big in every dimension, it would cost 8x the power. The maximum power that can gained from reducing area is capped at 64x, though you can reduce area further if you so desire.

**Power Stockpile**
Cost: 25 SP

You have a power stockpile that stockpiles the excess energy from your powers. Any time when a power isn't actively being used at 100%, it instead fills this stockpile with energy that can later be used to boost your other powers. Purely synergistic powers that don't do anything on their own don't give energy, as they don't have any mass excess that could be utilized. The excess energy gained from a power is proportional to both it's SP cost and how much of it is currently unused, and the same applies to the costs when boosting a power. This isn't perfectly efficient, causing you only to gain half as much energy as you should.  

**Creation vs. Destruction**
Cost: 15 SP

Powers come in various shapes and sizes, but the vast majority bottle down to two noticeable differences. Creation and Destruction. This upgrade forces you to choose between which one you’ll have an inherent affinity towards. Meaning if you select Creation, you’ll find all of your powers and abilities that align with it steadily increasing in arbitrary fields like potency, speed, and efficacy, with their advancement never stopping, eventually becoming virtually unrecognizable from their base counterparts. The inverse is also true if you would select destruction.  
This ability can partially work on certain powers, such as Divine Magic being empowered when smiting foes, but losing the bonus when creating barriers on allies.

**Automatic Defense**
Cost: 5 SP
Required: (Thinker) Danger Sense, or Sixth Sense

Your powers now operate much more smoothly, requiring almost no conscious effort on your part. Your danger sense is also much more refined, capable of intuiting a much greater deal of information, almost acting as form of clairvoyance.  
Your ability to anticipate danger is now tied directly to your reflexes and other powers, allowing your powers to act in your defense, even when you’re unaware, unconscious, or otherwise incapacitated. They’ll automatically move your body out of the way such as activating your flight, teleporting you away, or even simply moving your body’s muscles reflexively to defend you.  
This will only happen should you under normal circumstances wish for it, allowing you to harm yourself if you wish, albeit it’ll automatically minimize it as much as possible to meet your need.

**Autonomous**
Cost: 5 SP
Required:Automatic Defense

All of your powers are now operating under a single premise: if you were to want it to happen, it will. You’ll never fail to activate your flight when you jump off a building, won’t accidentally drop your force field because you got distracted, never forget to return to human form before making your way through a small door, etc.  
The same goes for any constructs you may create with your power, with them now capable of acting as you would wish them to even when not aware. They’ll collect information if you normally would wish them to, they’ll fight an enemy if you would normally direct them to do so, etc. They’re capable of acting entirely autonomously, always acting in a manner that you would agree with.

**Natural**
Cost: 5 SP

You have an uncanny and natural aptitude for your abilities, as if the usage and talent was ingrained into your instincts.  
You possess absolute and perfect control and understanding over all your powers, granting instinctive mastery and knowledge over your powers, able to control your power in its every manifestation as effortlessly as breathing, from its most explosive and powerful manifestation to its most subtle nuances.

**Absolute Authority**
Cost: 30 SP

For one of your chosen powers that grants you control over some kind of domain, be it element, concept, or anything else, your connection to this domain becomes absolute, making you its sole embodiment and granting you absolute authority over it. If someone tries to manipulate your domain through any means, even if they possess perfect copies of your power, your authority will effortlessly supersede all their attempts to do so. Moreover, you are always aware of any such attempt and can block it if you so desire. You can limit the level of awareness so it does not become a constant distraction.  
  
As your existence is irreversibly tied to your chosen domain, your ability to manipulate it cannot be separated from you by any means. Even if the power that originally allowed you to control the domain is stolen, suppressed, or otherwise manipulated, it will not hinder you in the slightest, and the power itself will eventually be restored.  
  
Lastly, as you now embody your chosen domain, you will live as long as there is even the smallest trace of it in existence or even beyond it, constantly regenerating from the most grievous wounds or even complete obliteration. You also serve as an origin point, ensuring the endless generation of the element or concept constituting your domain in a self-perpetuating cycle.  
Note: this upgrade does not grant the mastery over domain by itself; as such, it will be useless without some other power. And your initial ability to wield it will still be tied to this power, although you will be able to effortlessly discover new and creative uses of your domain.

*White Hole*
Required:Endless Reserves

You can now generate an endless amount of your chosen element, as well as make infinite sources of it, like a never-extinguishing fire, an endless well of water, or an infinite source of mana for use by yourself or others.

*Artifactorio*
Required: Thinker/Master (Organized Mind), or Quantum Supremacy
Required: Thinker/Master (Autopilot), or Toposophic Emergence

You can now program portions of your element with an algorithm for a certain behaviour, which it will continuously execute even if you are not in range to actively influence it, as if you were controlling it manually, or even allow this programmed portion to receive commands, mental or otherwise, from other designated users.  
This will even allow you to create semi-conscious elementals, whose behaviour you can program in any way you want.

**Equilibrium**
Cost: 5 SP
*"A sound soul dwells within a sound mind and a sound body." * 
  
A common challenge for any aspiring hero, villain, warrior, or mage is that while they may possess a powerful body capable of withstanding or healing from any blow, curse, or injury, their soul remains vulnerable to attacks. Alternatively, your soul might be exceptionally resilient, able to ignore or heal from most damage, but a well-placed arrow to the neck could still kill you as easily as a regular human. Or perhaps you possess both a strong body and soul, yet your mind remains vulnerable to illusions or manipulation.  
  
But with you, your mind, body, and soul have achieved Equilibrium.  
  
Now, your regeneration, endurance, resistances, and even immortality (if you possess it) are perfectly balanced across all three aspects. If your body can regenerate a missing limb in seconds, your soul can repair any damage to itself just as quickly. Similarly, if you have a resilient soul that can resist or heal from harm, your body will respond in kind, regenerating or resisting damage just as effectively. Your mind, in turn, becomes more resistant to control and can swiftly recover from hostile telepathic attacks.  
  
For example, if your body is resistant to curses, poisons, or forces that erode it, your soul will be equally resistant to those that target it, and your mind will either ignore or rapidly fight off attempts at manipulation while recovering from attempts to destroy it.  
This state of Equilibrium does not grant you any new abilities on its own, but it ensures that any powers you already possess or acquire will apply equally to your body, mind, and soul.

**Ah, yes. My anti-[X] Technique. I haven't used this since the Heian Era.**
Cost: 10 SP

You have the uncanny ability to randomly "remember" a technique, spell, power, or unique expression of your power that happens to be the right ability to either counter or mitigate whatever negative thing you're going against.  
What this means is that if you were facing someone who is about to hit you with a massive attack, you may come up with a new way to use your powers that would allow you to block, redirect, or even nullify said attack. If someone is about to mind control you, then you might end up "remembering" that you had a special way of using your powers to protect your mind.  
This does not give you powers by itself, nor does it let you suddenly do things that you could not potentially do before. For example, if someone is shooting a fireball and you have magic, you might "remember" an anti-fire ward spell. But if you did not have magic, then you would not "remember" such an ability and would either have to dodge or hope you don’t burn.

# Powers/Power Components




## Foundation Powers


**Polybius Remastered**
Cost: 12 SP
You gain 3 slots that can be filled with very weak powers, roughly equivalent in strength to a 3 SP power; they can be either weakened versions of powers found in this CYOA or present in the world(s) you visit, like Quirks from MHA, Esper Powers from Raildex, Magic or Psionics from D&D, Kryptonian or Green Martian biology from DC, and so on. The only exception is Polybius Remastered itself.

Of course, when weakened, your Kryptonian powers would only provide you with a minor enhancement in strength and durability, the ability to float a few inches above the ground and move at a slow pace, and some control of the direction when you fall, while retaining a major weakness to Kryptonite.
You can switch those powers whenever you want. While a power is in a slot, it will slowly grow in strength through use or training. However, this process is very slow, around 1 SP every twelve days if you train for several hours every day. The growth is retained if the power is switched out then later recalled.
The other component of this power is a pool of energy that can be used to accelerate the growth of your powers and provide temporary boosts in strength. Your energy pool takes 24 hours refill from empty. You can divert part of this regeneration towards power growth; when equally split between your slots, each power grows by 1 SP every nine days passively. You can also burn an hour worth of energy to increase the strength of a power by 20% for 5 minutes; this buff does not stack.
Growth slows down every 12 SP and each stage adds 3 days to the time it takes for the power to grow stronger. It slows down even further when it reaches 60 SP, where the time to grow doubles every 5 SP until it reaches 120 SP, where growth stops entirely.

You can choose to permanently lock a slot to a specific power, which increases its growth rate by 100% in exchange for the ability to switch it out. If you lock all slots, the growth rate increases by another 50%, for a total of 250%.


**Architect Jr.**
Cost: 12 SP

You have 3 slots that can host powers.  
This power has a pool of energy that can be used to create and improve powers. The pool generates one charge every 8 hours and has the capacity to hold 12 charges. You can spend three charges to create a weak power of your choice, equivalent to 3 SP in strength, inside of a slot. It takes 5 minutes for the power to form. If all of your slots are full, you can spend 1 charge to either archive a power, swap one active power with one from the archive, or restore one power from the archive. This process also takes 5 minutes.  
The powers in your slots grow in strength through use or training. However, this process is very slow, around 1 SP every twelve days if you train for several hours every day. You can spend charges to modify aspects of the power to your liking or increase its strength. It takes 9 charges to grow a power by 1 SP. However, growth slows down every 12 SP and each stage requires 3 additional charges to grow stronger. It slows down even further when it reaches 60 SP, where the number of charges doubles every 5 SP until it reaches 120 SP, where growth stops entirely.  
You can sacrifice a power worth 12 SP (84 charges) to either gain one new slot or increase the number of charges generated every 8 hours by one. The rank of power you need to sacrifice increases for every upgrade, shared between slots and charge generation, until you reach 60 SP (or 876 charges) where it stays constant.

*Unified Slots*
Required: Polybius Remastered
You no longer need to spend charges to archive, swap, or fill slots, and creating 3sp powers is now free of charge. Additionally, Polybius Remastered’s energy pool can now be shared with Architect Jr.’s powers to increase their passive growth rate or provide temporary buffs. 
Beyond that, you now have the option to spend Architect Jr.'s charges to boost powers created by Polybius Remastered. Slots made by Architect Jr. can also be locked in the same way as Polybius Remastered. If needed, you can spend three charges to unlock a locked slot, whether it was created by Architect Jr. or Polybius Remastered.

**Weaver of Destinies**
Cost: 10 SP

You have gained the ability to perceive the threads of fate connecting people to their destinies, including your own. These threads display various colors, reflecting the level of fortune or misfortune in each person's life. Darker threads indicate unfortunate destinies, while lighter threads signify good fortune. Through physical contact with these threads, you gain insight into the near future of the individual, revealing crucial moments known as "Opportunities." These Opportunities represent instances of either extraordinary good or profound misfortune awaiting the person.  
You possess the capacity to intervene in someone's life during these Opportunities, potentially averting their impending misfortunes and enhancing your own threads of destiny slightly. This intervention also serves to lighten the person's thread, leading them towards a brighter path. Alternatively, you can choose to exploit the fortunate Opportunities of others, causing their threads to darken. Continuously engaging in this act could eventually turn the target threads completely black, resulting in a scenario where every aspect of the affected individuals' lives would be plagued by incredible misfortune.

**The Game of Life**
Cost: 15 SP

Welcome to "The Game Of Life", through this power you hold the fate of your actions in your hands. This power offer three main functions: Dice, Reroll, and Devilish Luck.  
*Dice*: Imagine materializing a magical D20 dice before any crucial action you take. This enchanting dice brings an element of chance to your endeavors. Roll a 1, and your action might face some obstacles. Roll between 2 and 5, and there's no extra modifier for success. But don't worry, things start looking up from there! Rolling between 6 and 10 increases your chances of success. Land between 11 and 15, and your action becomes not only more likely to succeed but also more effective. With a roll between 16 and 19, your action gains a supernatural touch, significantly boosting the odds of success. And if you manage to land that elusive 20, your action could defy logic itself, as probability itself bends to ensure your action have at least a 50% chance of succeeding! Remember, you can summon the Dice up to 3 times each day to sway fate in your favor.  
*Reroll*: Have you ever wished you could turn back time to make better choices? With Reroll, that dream becomes a reality. You possess the ability to rewind time from a mere 10 seconds up to a generous 5 minutes! Made a hasty decision or took a wrong turn? Did you have a bad Dice roll? No worries! Simply trigger the Reroll and get another shot at it. However, like any precious gift, this power is limited to 3 uses per day, so use it wisely and purposefully.  
*Devilish Luck*: Once every three days, you have the opportunity to embrace an hour of sheer fortune with Devilish Luck. During this time, the very fabric of probability bends to ensure that you experience an unprecedented streak of serendipity. Opportunities fall into your lap, things seem to work out effortlessly, and life smiles upon you in countless ways. Use this power sparingly, and remember that its effects last for one hour only.

**Daily Login System**
Cost: 30 SP
You have gained the Daily Login System. Everyday, you can log in to your system and gain an award. The award can range from powers to objects. Normal rewards are usually either common objects or weak powers (1-5 SP), but you can gain special rewards by logging in continuously for a few days. A week of continuous logging in will get you an uncommon object or an above average power (5-10 SP). A month of continuous logging in will get you a rare object or a rare power (10-20 SP). A year of continuous logging in will get you a legendary object or a legendary power (20-50 Sp). The rewards will be based of your achievements and day to day life.

**Figurines Collector**
Cost: 20 SP

You have been chosen by the realm where shadows dance and imagination intertwines with reality. Once a day, you can summon forth a perfect living doll crafted from the depths of your own shadow. These dolls can take the form of original characters from the depths of your creativity or be inspired by existing characters.  
  
Each doll possesses a unique power, derived either from its inherent nature or based on the character it represents. These powers, will initially remain within the realm of street-tier abilities but offer a glimpse of formidable potential. Though initially modest, these powers shall flourish and expand over time, growing in strength and versatility alongside your own mastery.  
  
When crafting a doll based on an existing character, it is not merely their appearance that is captured but also their knowledge and personality. These dolls embody the essence of the characters they represent, allowing them to act with the same wisdom and motivations. However, regardless of whether they are original creations or replicas of beloved characters, the dolls are bound to you by an unyielding loyalty, their unwavering devotion solely directed towards you.  
  
Additionally, you are also able to store and recall these dolls into your own shadow. When the dolls face defeat or succumb to injuries, they are instantly recalled to the sanctuary of your shadow. Within this ephemeral refuge, they are restored to full vitality, their wounds healing as if they were never inflicted. After three days, you can summon them forth once more, ready to stand by your side and fulfill their purpose with unflinching loyalty.  
  
Initially, you can maintain an active roster of seven dolls at any given time. However, as your mastery deepens and your connection with shadows grows stronger, the number of dolls you can command will expand, allowing you to harness a greater ensemble of allies in your endeavors.

*Familiar Collector*
Required:Familiar Contract

Your ability to make familiar contracts and the ability to summon living dolls from your shadows synergized. All of your dolls will benefit from a familiar contract, and you will also grant the benefits of being bound to your shadows to a normal familiar. If your familiar is weaker than the street level baseline power, they will be boosted to that level, sometimes even gaining new abilities and powers depending on their existing skills and personality.  
  
The number of dolls you can have in your active roster is also partially lifted, as you can now have any number of them being active, but you still only start with seven slots for healing and reviving within your shadow, and if you have more of them injured or dead, they will be in a stasis and waiting in queue for healing. The rate of growth and affinity attunement your familiars get within your soul is also split between the number of them bathing in your energy.

*Figurine’s Sanctuary*
Required:Terrestrial Inventory

You can use energy from the Terrestrial Inventory to create new dolls or enhance existing ones with greater power.  
  
This follows the same logic as Terrestrial Inventory: the stronger the doll, the more energy it takes to create or upgrade it. For example, creating a cosmic-level being to life would require 120 SP worth of energy.

**Authority**
Cost: 15 SP

You have awoken your Authority, transforming you as a self-actualized conceptual being. The strength of your Authority, otherwise known as your Weight, is dependent on how much you have trained and experienced. Each step on your journey boosts your physical and mental capabilities, gradually unlocking incredible powers and abilities tied to your training focus.  
  
Your Authority only grows broader as you experiment, the more you delve into a specific domain, such as strength, intelligence, magic, or any other skill, the more your understanding of that concept expands. In addition to your natural self-actualizing capabilities, your Authority acts as a resource that can be allocated, although not consumed, to specific parts of your being. Eventually putting more Authority into your capacity to travel or traverse space could find you crossing miles of space with each step. Enforcing your will to live via your Authority could strip away the very concept of mortality from your being, rending your immortal and undying for as long as you will it.  
Through a permanent allocation of your Authority, known as an Aspect, you are able enhance or add something to your being. The amount of Authority that goes into every individual Aspect is up to you, it can be a one time thing, where you don’t add any more Authority beyond the initial amount, you can add more Authority later on as you grow, you can even have it so a constant percentage of your Authority is devoted an Aspect as you grow.  
Aspects are considered your new baseline, allowing you to both train your Aspects over time as well as an enhancement through the temporary allocation of Authority. If you do inevitably want to remove an Aspect, you can either suppress it which allows you to recall it in the future, or permanently sunder it from your being, removing it entirely as if it was never there.

UPGRADE

**Aristocrat**
Cost: 3 SP
Required: Authority

You were born a blue blood, a nobility of the highest order. Your Authority reflects this, self-actualizing your own power to a higher level, tremendously increasing the fluidity and strength of your Authority. Your Aspects grow as if they received the full amount of your Authority’s growth, understand that you do not actually lose any Authority for this new method of development. Temporarily and permanently allocating Authority is now qualitatively more effective. Even temporarily allocating your Authority will permanently increase your base level by a small fraction of what the original boost was if utilized effectively  
There are no limits to what you can achieve through your self actualizing capabilities, although that does not mean that everything will be easy. You will now receive even greater benefits from performing outstanding feats.

**Warrior**
Cost: 3 SP
Required: Authority

Your Authority is attuned to combat in all its forms, granting you an instinctual understanding of how to manipulate your body and Authority for proper combat. Martial techniques will come to you as if you were born to use them. Through a small concentrated effort you can create Methods, powerful techniques that harness your Authority and its Aspects to dramatically enhance your capabilities.  
Mundane techniques can be blended together to form an art that could let even a mortal fight against those that are supernatural. You can create both mundane techniques in addition to Methods. While Methods can be easily created, it takes true dedication and insight to elevate and evolve a Method to new heights. Methods can be utilized in conjunction with one another or merged for greater effect.  
You start off knowing 4 Methods as a starting bonus, one devoted to the offense, one for defense, another for utility, and a final one for movement. While these four starting Methods are nothing incredible, they can be taken to unto


**100 Sacred Treasures**
Cost: 25 SP
You now have the power to instantly summon and dismiss 100 sentient and intelligent entities that you can seamlessly communicate telepathically with no matter the distance.
The entities' collective strength grows as you ascend the hierarchy, reaching its pinnacle at entity 100. For instance, entity number 10 surpasses entity number 1 in every conceivable way by a factor of 100.
Initially, you can only summon the number 1 entity, manifesting as twin dire wolves, double the size of an adult male polar bear. Each wolf exhibits ten times the physical strength and speed of an elite Olympic male athlete, has super senses, and with durability capable of easily deflecting concentrated medium-caliber artillery fire. Their claws and teeth are sharp enough to cleave through steel, and they possess the special ability to traverse through shadows, manipulating them at will.

Each entity boasts unique supernatural abilities, ranging from shadow manipulation, elemental control, to healing, and telekinesis, etc. These special abilities become increasingly potent and fantastical as you ascend the ladder. These entities also exhibit enhanced passive growth, becoming stronger with increased utilization of their abilities.
To summon higher-level entities, such as entity number 2, you must summon them and defeat them using your own abilities. If you successfully defeat them, you gain control over them, enabling unrestricted summoning. In the event of defeat, the entity will never kill you and will disappear for 24 hours before the process can be initiated again. Each entity that you successfully defeated or was already able to summon like entity number 1, will demonstrate an unwavering and unconditional allegiance in perpetually serving you, this bond can never be broken under no influence, not even your own.

Free from the need for sustenance and immune to fatigue, these entities, if vanquished, require a 24-hour regeneration period before they can be summoned again at full capacity. Unless dismissed, they persistently remain in your service; they might also develop a unique personality of their own, if you so allow it.
*Fel-Ascended Treasures*
Required:Fel Blood (Warcraft)
The infusion of Mannoroth the Destructor's blood with the entities from your 100 Sacred Treasures has birthed a transformation of unparalleled might. All facets of their physical attributes has been enhanced by a factor of 2.5, this also includes their innate potential for overall growth.
They are now totally immune against harmful magical influences. Adversarial spells are rendered impotent, including an immunity to all illnesses, diseases, and poisons. They are also now nigh-impossible to affect through psychic means, though they can still use magic or psychic abilities with great efficiency. In fact, their control and talent with it is even further augmented.
If vanquished, they will now require only a period of 12 hours instead of 24 hours to be summoned again at full capacity.


**The Three Musketeers**
Cost: 15 SP

The benevolence of fortune shines upon you as the goddess of luck bestows three intelligent humanoid pawns in your favor.  
You hold the artistic freedom to craft their overall appearance and personalities. A telepathic link unites all four of you, fostering seamless communication and coordination, transcending any distance.  
Each pawn specializes in one of the three major combat roles: DPS, Tank, and Support.  
  
Although starting at a weak power level—barely street level—these pawns compensate with an incredible innate potential for growth. As living entities, given sufficient time, with each battle, practice session, and experience gained, they manifest increasingly fantastical abilities tailored to their respective roles. For example, an end-game Support pawn could resurrect the dead, instantly heal fatal wounds, buff teammates, debuff enemies, dispel curses, cast curses, and much more. In terms of potential alone, your Three Musketeers stand unparalleled in their respective fields.  
Sustenance and fatigue are of no consequence to your pawns. If vanquished, they only require a 24-hour period before reappearing in your general vicinity. Devoted solely to you, their loyalty is unwavering, impervious to any influence, even your own. In the event of your demise, the pawns will have a window of 72 hours to bring about your revival; failure to do so will result in their death as well.
*Expy*
Required:Template Cosplay

Instead of just you having a template, each and everyone of your Musketeers have one template slot too. Besides just gaining the powers, skills and items of the template, they can also gain the appearance, memories and personality to varying levels, if you allow it. They may only have one slot but you're able to swap their template with a new one and they do not lose synchronization with it—not only that but it will be at the same progress if you swap them back.  
These templates do not erase their initial abilities as pawns and runs parallel to their growth from that. Their slots and templates do not count towards your ability to gift others a single template every 24 hours, doing this as well will effectively allow them to have two templates active at once.

UPGRADE
**Three For One**
Cost: 10 SP
Required:The Three Musketeers
"Individually mighty, collectively indomitable."  
  
The concept of unity has become an intrinsic part of the core connection binding you four entities under the mantle of pawns and master.  
Collaboration among your three musketeers yields substantial benefits based on the undertaken activity. For example, when the trio coordinates offensively to bring down an enemy, they experience a 50% buff to all their combat capabilities and abilities. Similarly, when they unite in defense of a target, their defensive abilities receive a 50% boost. Essentially, the assembly of the three musketeers always ensures a consistent advantage and buffs across the aspects they represent—DPS, tank, and support—depending on the circumstances they encounter. This wouldn't negatively affect their capabilities in any way should they act alone.  
The concept of unity has also extended to their master. Now, the only way to inflict harm of any nature on you, is for all three musketeers to be vanquished.

**Copy-Fusion-Evolve**
Cost: 25 SP

This power is intricately linked to your soul, a unique force solely yours, akin to the semblances in RWBY. The power unfolds with distinct features and is governed by specific rules. When activated, it manifests as an interface visible only to you.  
  
The first feature is the Copy Ability, enabling you to replicate any power, skill, or bloodline encountered, though limited to one at a time. A prerequisite condition must be met to choose what to copy, ranging from friendship to overcoming a specific challenge. The copied attribute initiates at level one, necessitating training through real-life application or combat to reach level one hundred. Conditions may vary, such as defeating the source using a designated skill or surviving a confrontation. Skills encompass a broad spectrum, from weapon mastery to elemental resistance.  
The second ability, Fusion, permits the fusion of two or more copied powers or skills. A preview of the resulting fusion and its effects is presented, allowing cancellation if undesirable. However, fusion entails losing the involved powers or skills, necessitating recopying, which resets them to level one.  
The third ability, Evolve, comes into play once a power, skill, or bloodline reaches level one hundred. Upon evolution, it undergoes transformative changes, potentially becoming an entirely new power or skill. A list of possible evolutions is provided for your selection, or randomness can be embraced. Post-evolution, the new power or skill reverts to level one, demanding further leveling.  
  
Restrictions apply, allowing a maximum of 25 powers and 25 skills, with bloodline abilities counting as powers. Attempting to exceed this limit results in losing other elements, potentially including memories. However, the power provides the option to delete any unwanted power or skill, offering a degree of control over your acquired abilities. You will gain more slots over time through effort and dedicated training.  
In the future, you will be able to share any power or skill you possess with those you trust or bond with.


**VitaSync**
Cost: 10 SP

Magic runs through your veins. Your spirit is deeply tied to your bones. Your nerves carry psionic signals that your mind responds to. In all things, your body is something that could be considered a reflection of your abilities. Any time you bump into something esoteric or otherwise supernatural, you’ll find you have a little potential to use it that improve your body, which in turn allows you to improve your powers.  
The way this works is that you carry an awareness of what parts of your body hold various effects, though generally, they will be lumped in with similar parts if viable. For example, the Force would grow just the same as any other psychic power through the improvement of your nervous system, despite the presence of midichlorians in your cellular structure. From there, you may work on your body to improve these capabilities however you wish, be it naturally, artificially, etc.  
In general, the structure of your self-improvements to your own system will reflect the improvements your various supernatural systems gain. Take up a regimen that leaves your cardiovascular system more robust, and you'll find your magical abilities generally growing in breadth and depth in a controlled way, whereas if you give yourself a high-tech cybernetic heart to better circulate blood, you'll find your magic vastly faster to respond and more powerful, but with far less room to organically grow, for instance.  
This power is not without risks, as significant damage to your body will tear at your ability to cast spells, channel your spirit, or focus your psionics to a proportional degree to the damage you take. It should be noted, however, that these very same things can provide a level of healing themselves, should you train them well enough - even to the point of a separated sample of blood bringing you back from the dead, after some time, or other such things. However, you will not have any special level of healing to begin with, just a slow, steady, human-level recovery rate.

*My Body is a Temple*
Required: Magic And Muscle (Mashle), or Conditioning

Through VitaSync, the synchronicity between your body and your magic has been extended to all the supernatural systems you wield. Now, not only does strengthening your body result in your abilities becoming stronger, but strengthening your abilities strengthens your body in turn, resulting in your body and all your supernatural abilities constantly matching each other in might.  
Additionally, if the bodily system carrying one of your supernatural systems is damaged, the rest of your body can now compensate in part. For example, the psionics in your nerves or the spiritual energy in your bones can support your magic in your veins if some of them are cut.


**The Study of Laws and Concepts**
Cost: 20 SP

You possess the rare ability to study and realize the Laws and Concepts that underpin all of existence. These represent various aspects of reality, such as Thunder, Fire, or even higher concepts such as death. Most beings, like gods, hold a limited degree of control over specific Laws or Concepts. For example, a deity like the Raiden Shogun may command 50% control over the concept of Thunder. Beings with higher control can often exercise their mastery unrestricted, even over others who share lesser control of the same Law or Concept.  
  
However, your ability is unique. You can study any Law or Concept, gradually going from powerless to being able to use powers or abilities based upon the percentage of the law or concept that you have learned. Through study, your mastery over the chosen subject grows, granting you new powers tied to that domain. Once you reach 100% mastery of a Law or Concept, you achieve its Truth, unlocking 10% true control of it. This allows you to apply that Law or Concept across different worlds. If you ascend further to 100% Truth realization, you gain full omniversal control, wielding the power to shape reality at the highest level.  
  
For instance, by studying a concept such as Solid or Sharp, you can manifest its principles in versatile ways. You might combine it with other Concepts, like Fire or Barriers, creating entirely new applications. Once mastered, these powers grow exponentially stronger, enabling feats such as defeating powerful beings or achieving seemingly impossible goals. You can also combine your concepts with each other to create unique effects, or even create a true fusion expanding the power of your concepts greatly, true fusions will be harder to achieve just not impossible.  
Some Laws and Concepts are inherently more challenging to study and master. Examples include Higher laws and concepts such as Finality, Death, Life, Dreams, Infinity, and Kabbalah's Tree of Life, they will just take a long time to study, master, and eventually realize the truth. However, any Truth you realize significantly enhances your abilities, empowering you to challenge even divine beings.  
  
You can study up to three Laws or Concepts simultaneously, with the option to pause progress on one and switch focus as needed. Additionally, delving into forbidden knowledge, such as the domains of Outer Gods, comes with risks. These forbidden Laws and Concepts may have profound effects on your being, abilities, and even your sanity.  
Approach this journey with caution. The deeper your understanding, the greater your power—and the higher the stakes.

*Idle Study Partitions*
Required: Idle Trainer, or Archive

Your ability to study laws and concepts has evolved. You can now create "Study Partitions," which passively study your chosen laws and concepts while you do nothing or even while actively studying another law or concept. This allows for continuous progress without needing to pause or switch focus. Initially, you can create two partitions, with an additional partition becoming available each year. However, overusing this ability may strain your mind, so caution is advised.  
As you add more partitions and accumulate knowledge, a vast simulated world—the "Library of Knowledge"—will take shape. This library reflects the depth of your studies and serves as a testament to your progress. Within this simulated world, mastery and understanding of laws and concepts are accelerated. Instead of directly experiencing these concepts yourself, your alternate self within the study partition absorbs the brunt of the experience. Also with each new partition created the strain on your mind will be reduced as you get used to the current number of partitions.  
By using "Idle Trainer" or "Archive" you can summon simulations of beings who possess mastery over your chosen concepts. These beings may include experts in abstract disciplines, such as a master of martial arts like "The Edge of Taixuan." Learning from these simulated teachers allows for faster progress in your studies. The more teachers you summon who specialize in a single concept, the quicker your learning rate for that particular law or concept.  
Over time, your study partitions will naturally generate new attacks and powers derived from the vast archive of knowledge within the simulated world. These innovations provide practical applications for your studies, enabling you to advance not only in understanding but also in skill and capability.


**Temporally Challenged**
Cost: 20 SP

_Time is an enigma, it never quite acts how you expect._  
Time doesn’t truly work around you as it should. Your natural state of existence is at a dead stop, able to perceive things around you in frozen time. Thankfully, with a bit of effort you should be able to right yourself into moving at regular speeds.  
This isn’t all however, as by focusing your will, and undergoing a not insignificant amount of training, you can change the flow of time around you. This means you could create time-locked zones where not even oxygen can move, slow bullets, reverse local time, bring things back from future timelines and the past, and more.  
It is worth noting: going forwards is always easier than back, speeding time up, advancing age, all of these things take about half of the effort and energy it takes to do the inverse. Traveling back in time any substantial distance is a monumental feat of will and skill, for instance.  
Learn enough about how Temporal Meta-Chrono-Physics works and one day you might truly be a time-warping monster to behold, but until then I’m afraid we’ll just have to call you **Temporally Challenged**.


**Theft**
Cost: 20 SP

You’ve gained the ability to steal anything, not just physically but conceptually. What this means is that you can take anything from anyone or anything, whether it's tangible, intangible, or entirely abstract.  
Steal someone’s strength and they’ll grow weak as you gain what they lost. Steal their immortality, their ability to lie, their confidence, their fire resistance, their voice, their divinity, their potential, or even their friendships. You can even steal their powers, leaving them helpless while you wield their abilities as your own. You can steal their fate, twist the future meant for them, or take their memories and leave nothing behind. If it exists in any form, you can take it.  
Theft applies to more than just people. You can steal a building’s structural integrity, a forest’s dryness, a concept’s relevance, or a technique’s uniqueness. You could take the sharpness out of every blade in an army, the originality out of an artist’s work, or the light of day from the sky itself.  
The things you steal become yours to keep, to use, or to return. This can be permanent, temporary, or conditional. You can steal from groups, objects, locations, phenomena, or even from entire systems or ideas. Steal the need for fuel from a machine, the definition of law from a courtroom, or the effect of gravity from a falling object.  
At first, your theft is simple and grounded. Small physical objects come easiest, and things like tools, weapons, or basic traits offer little resistance. More abstract or conceptual targets, such as powers, fate, or identity, can be taken, but doing so is difficult and draining, sometimes nearly impossible. The deeper or more essential something is, the more effort it takes to steal and hold. The more you try to carry at once, the more the strain builds as pressure weighs on you. If you push yourself too far, you may begin to lose your grip, allowing some things to slip away as you're forced to let them go.  
While you begin with only smaller-scale thefts coming easily to you, such as minor traits, basic abilities, surface-level emotions, or single moments of luck, your power can grow with use, sharpening your grip and expanding your reach. These things may stay with you for a time, but without rest or experience, you’ll struggle to maintain your hold. With continued use, your power grows rapidly, and what once took effort to keep can be held with ease as your limitations begin to loosen. In time, even the most complex things on the greatest scales can be stolen so completely and deeply that they remain permanently yours as if they always were. There is no real limit to how far your theft can eventually go.  
You can choose how thoroughly to steal. You might take just a portion of someone’s charisma, or all of it. You can steal something and make it so no one notices it’s missing, or make it glaringly obvious to all.  
You can also freely choose what to steal and from whom, allowing you to take only what you want without affecting related elements. You’ll intuitively steal only what you intend to steal, never causing unintended loss unless doing so intentionally.

**Epithet Collector**
Cost: 10 SP

You now have the power to gain epithets or titles when you accomplish something noteworthy or if enough people attribute something to you. There are titles for everything, and each one grants you some kind of positive effect — whether that be an affinity for something, a physical buff, or anything else, as long as it stems from you. These titles can be turned off or on, but can never be lost, and there is no limit to how many you can have active at once. The title of **“Vampire Slayer”**, for example, would give you an advantage against vampires of all kinds, with your attacks hitting harder against them and making it easier to pick up on their weaknesses.  
  
The more specific the title, the greater the buff. A title like **“Element Master”** would give you a 20% boost in using and controlling all elements, but one such as **“Master of Fire”** could make you immune to all natural fire, give you an easier time learning anything related to fire, and reduce the energy cost of any fire magic by half.  
You are able to set up to 3 titles as public. This makes it so that anyone who sees or knows about you instantly knows the names of those titles, which may bring people trying to challenge you or believing you unworthy of being called that title — but in exchange, those titles get up to a 50% boost in all categories.  
At the beginning, you are able to select either 1 title that can give you a 100% collective boost in something, or 3 separate titles that each give a maximum boost of 30% in separate fields. Titles can only improve so much, and if a title is too strong for your body to handle, it will be downgraded until it can fit you — for instance, changing **“God of Fire”** into **"Flameborne"** or **“One Loved by Fire”**.
*Grand Epithet*
Required: Ancient Name (Genshin Impact)
Your Ancient name has been recognized as your main title standing above all others you will gain. It now has received a permanent 50% buff in whatever it provided for you and if you have more than 1 ancient name they all receive the same buff and you can choose any one or all of them to be public as your Main title always being the first thing people think of when they see you.  
Your Ancient name can now also grow stronger by absorbing related titles with similar domains to it to grant it new effects or increase the base strength of the title. Your main title is counted as separate and doesn’t affect your 3 public slots.

**One Thousand Cuts**
Cost: 5 SP

Most warriors plateau when no longer challenged. A seasoned swordsman can only sharpen their blade so much against a novice; without a worthy rival, progress stagnates. Growth demands friction—conflict against those who match or surpass you, a mirror that forces evolution.  
You felt it was a pain to leave the tutorial zone.  
Now, even foes beneath your level become stepping stones, their cumulative resistance shaping you. It’s arithmetic in motion: if your opponent possesses only half your strength, then facing two of them will yield the same growth as one battle with your equal. Ten weak foes, ten fragments of strength—they add up. Fight enough, and even the meek can forge the mighty.  
This applies to all parts of combat: physical effort, reaction speed, movement control, and decision-making. Even if the fights are easier, repeating them still builds physical conditioning and sharpens awareness. Over time, you will gain the same amount of experience and instinctual growth you would gain from fighting stronger opponents.

**Conceptual Enforcement**
Cost: 25 SP

You have learned how to actualize and enforce the intent behind your actions, using your metaphysical weight to enhance their effects. This begins rather weakly—merely making actions slightly more successful than they should be: a dodge carrying you farther and being more effective, an attempt at hiding leaving fewer traces, and so on. However, as the conceptual weight behind your actions grows stronger, so too do the effects of your enforcement—eventually bestowing supernatural traits and culminating in truly conceptual acts at higher levels.  
While low-level enforcement of a sword swing might merely cause the blade to cut slightly better than it should, medium-level enforcement could allow you to block or cut things you normally couldn’t—such as a simple steel sword slicing through metal like butter or even blocking a lightsaber. At the highest levels, you achieve truly conceptual feats: an attempt at hiding could become so effective that reality itself forgets your existence, allowing you to do things like achieve agelessness by hiding from the very flow of time.  
  
There are two ways to increase the conceptual weight you can bestow upon your actions. The first is by enriching your own existence—enhancing your metaphysical weight through some means. Whether through time and experience, sheer power, or something more exotic, the greater the meaning and significance behind your existence, the more force your actions will carry.  
The second method is more specialized: by repeatedly practicing an action, you increase the weight behind that specific act. Your mastery bestows further force. The speed of this development depends on how specific the action is. Mastering the entirety of swordsmanship to a conceptual level might take several lifetimes, while mastering a single sword stroke could be achievable within an average human lifespan.  
This effect is incredibly pervasive, capable of being applied to any act—both mundane tasks and the use of powers. For example, enforcing fire magic might initially make your flames burn hotter and spread faster than they should. But with enough metaphysical weight, your flames could eventually burn through space, time, fate, and other conceptual entities.

*Enlightened Enforcement*
Required:An Enlightenment

Your Oneness with a concept has permanently altered not just your essence but how you interact with it as well, which has in turn impacted your ability to enforce your actions.  
You experience rapidly accelerated development of conceptual weight and greater returns when enforcing your actions when said act falls under the umbrella of your enlightenment. For example an enlightenment relating to oneness with nature would make actions relating to nature benefit more from your conceptual enforcement. The benefits are greater and more efficient the closer the act committed aligns with your enlightenment.

*Spiritual Decree*
Required: Prime Soul (ULTRAKILL), or Spiritual Ascendance

Your soul is simply worth more than others, its presence fundamentally greater than that of others. And with this your metaphysical importance has soared, your every action carrying orders of magnitude more conceptual weight.  
Even from the beginning you have enough force to make your actions minorly warp reality to align with their purpose and intent. Hiding causes your presence to fade, spear thrusts unerringly seek weak points, dodges warp space to turn sure hits into near misses, etc.
*Devilish Authority*
Required:What Do You Fear? (Chainsaw Man)

As the embodiment of a concept tethered to the fear of an entire species, you naturally exert more influence upon the world, especially when it comes to what concept you represent.  
As the manifestation of the fear of a concept, you are naturally conceptual important, possessing greater metaphysical weight which only grows greater the more your concept is feared.  
But this is only the tip of the iceberg, the real benefit lies in your ability to derive extra conceptual force from the fear of what you represent. You can use it as an extra source of weight, albeit one which can only be used to enforce acts related to your nature and powers as a devil.

**Covenant**
Cost: 5 SP

You can declare a desired reward, anything from the very specific—such as a weapon that ignores all defenses, or the power to become a dragon—to something vague like “I want to be stronger.  
  
Rewards can be concrete (a weapon, wealth, abilities), abstract (love, influence, knowledge, safety), or even a mixture of unrelated things. You may ask for one prize or several at the same time.  
Requests do not have to be precise. A vague wish is enough, and the power will always determine the perfect and most fitting form of the reward, even if you aren’t fully sure what you want. A vague request will be interpreted into an ideal result.  
  
Sometimes, even when a request is made very specifically, the result may be adjusted and refined into something better than the user thought to ask for. In this way, every reward feels like the “true” version of what was wanted, whether clearly named or only half-formed in intent.  
You may also choose how the reward comes to you. It can be produced directly by the power at the end, or it can be gained naturally along the course of the quest itself. Smaller, related rewards may also appear as milestones while progressing. Rewards do not necessarily need to be aligned with the quest you take, although if you want to acquire it naturally along the questline, it will naturally accommodate that.  
When a request is made, a quest forms. You’ll immediately know its name, its themes, and a general sense of what lies ahead. You gain an instinctive feel for the difficulty involved and a constant awareness of your progress as you advance. The quest keeps you updated, lets you track your current status, and shows you the next few objectives and steps, though never the entire quest.  
When the quest first forms, you have the ability to accept it as is or renegotiate it. You can raise the difficulty for greater or more numerous rewards, or lower it for smaller, safer rewards. You can also alter time-based components as well, expanding or crunching them for similar effects.  
You may also nudge the quest towards a certain style, whether combat-focused, investigative, social, or endurance-based. The final form, however, is always set by the power itself. Once accepted, the quest is fixed, and the only way out is to abandon it, forfeiting the prize. You can abandon a quest at any time; it will not prevent you from trying to get the same reward at a later time.  
You may have as many active quests as you want, although some may merge into one larger one where appropriate. Every quest is tailored to the user, taking the user’s requested rewards and their own capabilities into mind. The same request may demand little from someone strong but impose a great trial on someone weaker. This means that as you get more powerful, the difficulty scales in your favor.


**Desire Manifestation**
Cost: 15 SP

Within your existence lies a truly unique ability—the power to bridge desire and realization. Your cravings, when sustained and genuine, begin to manifest as tangible change, transforming both yourself and the world to fulfill them. This manifestation scales with the strength and depth of your craving. While you cannot fully control how your desires manifest at first, particularly in broad or undefined cravings, this control can itself be developed.  
At the lowest levels, this effect is subtle: a desire for strength may slightly accelerate muscle development or push your body to adapt more efficiently during training. Wanting to learn a skill may improve your memory, attention, and coordination toward that purpose. Desiring to survive may heighten your reflexes or resistance at critical moments, granting weak regenerative ability that slowly heals small cuts and bruises. Craving to enhance your existing powers can gradually refine their efficiency, raise their upper limits, or unlock new applications of those abilities.  
The stronger and more absolute your craving becomes, the greater the effects it produces. A sustained craving for strength could eventually reshape your physiology beyond normal limits, granting supernatural durability and might. A desire to master a skill could lead to instinctive understanding and talent beyond genius. Craving survival and growth could induce continuous forced evolution, allowing adaptation to nearly any environment or circumstance, or granting powerful regeneration capable of restoring deep wounds or even lost limbs. At higher levels, this ability can even act upon itself.  
Manifested effects tied directly to active cravings will weaken as the desire that sustains them fades. Once a craving loses its strength, abilities born purely from that yearning will diminish or vanish entirely. However, changes that have already become part of your being remain; only the ongoing growth or active manifestation tied to the craving ceases. For example, losing the desire for strength halts accelerated improvement but does not strip away the strength already attained. Likewise, refinements of self gained through desire persist as part of your nature, such as a talent or understanding developed through sustained yearning. With time and sufficient depth in a desire, its manifested effects can become imprinted, remaining even after the desire itself has faded.  
  
The power’s potential is limited by how deeply you are capable of craving. Ordinary human desire cannot reach far beyond the mundane. To manifest effects that alter reality itself requires an intensity of yearning that borders on inhuman—cravings so absolute that they define your being. But for you, there exists a unique ability, an innate faculty that allows the strength of your soul or the weight of your existence to directly determine how deeply you are capable of craving, actively deepening your capacity for desire as they grow, enabling you to reach and bear levels of craving that normal beings could never withstand without losing yourself to it.  
  
At the highest levels, the act of wanting itself becomes Law—a force encompassing all of existence, capable of warping probability, rewriting reality, and bending the world to fulfill your will, where all its manifested effects attain permanence, for the potential of this power is limitless.

**666 Evil Eyes (Essence Meta)**
Cost: 20 SP

You are the bearer of the 666 Evil Eyes, granting supernatural abilities to one of your eyes. The default eye, known as The Blankest Eye of The Great King of Normalcy, allows you to see all things supernatural, pierce illusions, and see through obstacles. Each of the 666 Evil Eyes has a unique name, changing the appearance of your eyes and providing specific powers related to its name.  
  
Using an Evil Eye other than the default requires effort and cannot be maintained constantly. With practice, you can extend its usage, but you need to return to the default form to rest your eye. These abilities are not fixed; they can grow and change with training and effort, becoming more potent and versatile without limits. Even new Evil Eyes not among the 666 can appear over time.  
  
To use a specific Evil Eye, you must first attune to it by using it. The more you use it, the stronger the connection becomes, increasing its chances of appearing again during selection until you can use it at will. You also start fully attuned to two randomly selected additional Evil Eyes.  
Among the 666 Evil Eyes, 99 are classified as Supreme Evil Eyes, appearing during extreme emotional stress or near-death experiences. These Eyes are incredibly powerful and can cause world-altering events when unleashed. Using them initially enters you into an unconscious berserker state, and their powers become unpredictable. Learning to control a Supreme Evil Eye's abilities is challenging but possible with great mental discipline and training.  
The power of the Evil Eyes is not tied to the physical form of your eye. If lost, the power transfers to your remaining eye or another body part until the lost eyes are replaced. You can grant copies of fully attuned Evil Eyes to others, instilling loyalty and providing them with similar, albeit weaker, powers initially. You can remove copies of Evil Eyes you've granted at any time.

**Mystery Slayer (Type-Moon)**
Cost: 10 SP

Yours is the power to cancel or destroy any manifestation of Mystery, erasing its supernatural expression, allowing you to counter and confront the metaphysical in whatever form it may appear; for this reason, you are a slayer of myths, an ender of fantasy, a killer of phantasms, and a revealer of mysteries. Though others throughout history have wielded similar abilities, none have your potential. You are not merely another hunter of mysteries but destined to become _The Slayer of Mystery_—once you have amassed enough power.  
  
The essence of your power lies in its ability to kill or eliminate Mysteries—entities or phenomena that transcend current human understanding. This grants you the unique capacity to "slay" Mysteries of any kind, whether they stem from alien science, supernatural magic, or any force beyond the established scope of the Human Order. As long as it exists outside the bounds of human comprehension, it can be neutralized by your power.  
At first, your strength is humble, barely registering as E-rank by most standards, granting only a minor conceptual edge in combating Mystery, subtly enhancing everything you do, whether offensive or defensive. Yet, even this minuscule amount of power allows an ordinary human to contend against the supernatural forces of the moonlit world, secret societies, and magical realms—provided they are well-prepared and use their abilities strategically.  
Additionally, this power synergizes seamlessly with abilities that drive innovation and expand humanity's collective knowledge. As the mysteries of the supernatural are unraveled and cataloged, your strength will naturally grow, feeding off humanity's increasing understanding and advancement. The more you unveil, the stronger you become—dismantling and countering the very essence of Mystery itself. For what better weapon is there against the darkness of Mystery than the light of discovery and understanding?  
  
Gradually, as you test your mettle against the supernatural, through whatever form it may take, growing stronger with each small victory. Eventually, you'll outgrow the scale altogether, being able to solidify the Human Order in an area with your mere presence at EX-Rank.  
  
This power, by its very nature, can lead to stagnation, as you may inadvertently destroy Mysteries faster than they can be assimilated and understood by the Human Order. In doing so, you disrupt the natural evolution of discovery and growth, risking humanity's progress and limiting its potential to explore and comprehend the unknown.
*Eternal Light of Civilization*
Required:Pioneer of the Stars (Type-Moon)

You are now more than just a slayer of Mysteries—you have become a guiding light of innovation, discovery, exploration, and progress. With the acquisition of the Star attribute, all facets of your power have been enhanced, transforming you into a "North Star" for others to look up to, drawing inspiration, motivation, and insight from your presence.  
As the embodiment of excellence, those who strive to follow in your footsteps and emulate you as their idol will find themselves unusually inspired. They'll absorb information more quickly, think more abstractly, and gain clarity in their actions as if your very existence accelerates their intellectual and personal growth.  
Not only does your presence reinforce the Human Order, but it also helps others to digest and assimilate once-incomprehensible Mysteries, expanding humanity's understanding of the unknown. You now serve as both protector and beacon, guiding others to grasp what was once beyond reach.
*The Extraordinary Gentleman*
Required:The Great Man Theory

You are no longer a mere slayer but have ascended into something far grander—a brilliant thinker of great rapport and a refined gentleman of many talents. With each Mystery you defeat, you gain the unique ability to _appropriate_ some of their strengths, learning to harness their abilities for your own purposes. Over time, as you defeat multiple Mysteries of the same type, your understanding of them shall deepen, enabling you to unlock peerless insights into their nature.  
Eventually, you may even bring down Mysteries once associated with the gods and entities of the same realm or nature to humanity's level, demystifying them and revealing their inner workings. In doing so, you will not only expand your achievements but also grant humanity unparalleled knowledge of the cosmos and heavens, transforming the unknown into accessible knowledge. Moreover, this new aspect will mitigate the risk of stagnation inherent in your ability, effectively allowing you to curate what grand wisdom humanity may attain.  
As a consequence of this new acquisition, you will also find yourself acting much more gentlemanly in everything you do, with such supreme grace and elegance as to mesmerize all who witness you.

**D.A.G. (Devour, Assimilate, Gift)**
Cost: 15 SP

In its essence, D.A.G. consists of three fundamental abilities that allow you to interact with the very essence of your enemies: Devour, Assimilate, and Gift.  
  
Devour is the deadliest facet, capable of consuming almost anything: from humans and monsters to angels, demons, and spiritual entities. At its core, Devour directly attacks the soul, but its reach is broader, able to consume energy, attacks, or even fragments of space. When using this ability, you absorb the complete or partial soul of the target, gaining a permanent 15% of their energy reserves, as well as fragments of their knowledge, skills, memories, and emotions. Through this ability, you not only acquire what the target has left behind but can also evolve the devoured skill or power, strengthening your abilities over time.  
However, this ability is not infallible. It will not work against divine beings or those significantly stronger than you unless your power increases. Additionally, when you only consume a fraction of the soul, what you gain is proportionally reduced. Devour also has a mental cost, as consuming too many souls too quickly can overwhelm your mind with the emotions and memories of the devoured. Fortunately, by spacing out its use, you can mitigate this effect and even retain the souls to gain multiple lives, should you wish.  
The physical manifestation of Devour is Amarok, a giant wolf bound to you. Amarok can teleport to defend you and tirelessly hunt its prey, dividing into a pack of smaller wolves if necessary. If Amarok is destroyed, it will simply reform when called. Note You can share Amarok's senses, and speak through it as well, Amarok also has the ability to shrink or grow depending on its needs, its most powerful ability is its power to adapt to any situation. Amarok is extremely durable and its strength is enough to toss around heavy duty vehicles.  
  
Assimilate, on the other hand, is the non-lethal version of your power. It allows you to defeat an opponent and steal what defines them, without the need to destroy their soul. When activating this ability, you will have 10 minutes to absorb what the opponent offers, but it will take 30 minutes to recharge it. The benefits you gain from using Assimilate include a permanent 5% increase in your energy reserves, a random trait (such as maximum health, ambidexterity, or innate talent), and, depending on the enemy, new knowledge, techniques, and skills. Unlike Devour, what you absorb is less invasive but equally powerful, allowing you to gain strength without the more destructive consequences of consuming a soul.  
Each skill you assimilate starts in its most basic form and will require training to fully develop. Additionally, any negative effects related to the assimilated skill are automatically removed, ensuring you only retain the useful parts. You cannot assimilate the same target more than once, and the results are always unpredictable.  
  
Lastly, Gift allows you to share what you have acquired with an ally. Whether it is a power, skill, or technique obtained through Devour, Assimilate, or natural development, you can permanently transfer it to another. However, this act has a price: the power you gift is lost to you forever.

**SPEEDRUNNER (Terminal Montage Mario)**
Cost: 30 SP
You gain the ability to see the source code of reality and manipulate it directly through seemingly nonsensical actions and movements, which may defy physics as you perform them. This power is limited by your understanding of the source code of the reality you reside in, along with your speed; with more speed, making it far easier to bend and even break reality.
However, some realities which hold more esoteric and complicated metaphysics or realms with higher powers. Being in such realities will make it harder for you to learn and manipulate reality, such as Marvel Comics and DC Comics, which are massively multidimensional realities and have various local gods that will not be happy with your meddling.
To grow stronger, you must overcome challenges and fights before leaping to another timeline to repeat this action endlessly. You can set a single special marker in space-time to create a starting line for your speedruns, which you can repeat as many times as you want. The faster you complete this process and the more you do it, the faster you will become until you eventually gain immeasurable speed. Once you reach this level, reality itself becomes your plaything, with you able to do anything. With enough speed, you can exist in multiple timelines at once, acting as a powerful form of immortality and granting you the ability to create time clones.
Starting off, you will have enough understanding of the source code where you reside and speed to move at sub-light speed, and treat the environment as a bounce house, and manipulate reality in small ways. You gain the knowledge of how to perform the terrifying backwards long jump, which allows you to treat nearly any surface as a launch pad, allowing you to increase your speed exponentially, and is your main means to jump to different timelines.
Now go forth and speedrun your way to glitch godhood.
*Ghost in the code*
Required:Beneath Notice
It would seem as though you have found a special glitch that allows you to stay hidden from any higher powers just up until you become strong enough to threaten them. This means you can freely gain power without any need to fear drawing unwanted attention.
*A NEED FOR SPEED*
Required:Monster of Desire
You have a NEED a need for speed, that is. Your obsession is focused on increasing your speed and control over reality above everything else. This desire will help and fuel your growth to levels unimaginable to such a degree that becoming a speedrunning god becomes an inevitable question of when, not if.
*INFINITE SPEED*
Required:Speed Force (DC Comics)
You have done it, you have attained the holy grail of Speedrunners, that is to say: INFINITE SPEED.
You no longer have any need to leap across timelines to gather speed, as you now have it in infinite amounts by default, thanks to the Speed Force. Your ability to use the Speed Force is also massively increased to such a degree that you become freely able to time-travel freely with no fear of causing any kind of time paradoxes.
The mental enhancements from the Speed Force allow you to more quickly and easily grasp the source code of reality. Even the trickiest and esoteric of realities become an open book to your enhanced mind. Dialing your abilities to the reality you reside in becomes nearly effortless, with you able to calibrate mundane realities near instantly and more complicated ones in weeks at most.
With this combination of powers, you become a virtual god of speed, able to almost effortlessly manipulate reality.


# Trump Powers (Empowers Other Powers)


**(Brute/Trump) Life Taker**
Cost: 6 SP 
You steal the remaining natural lifespan of anything you kill, increasing your own lifespan. This can work on non-human races however when killing anything functionally immortal or with extremely long lifespans the effects are weakened, only giving you a maximum of 999 years with diminishing results. 
You can boost any part of your body, be it your strength or your regeneration, at the cost of your lifespan. If you have others powers you can boost that too. You have an instinctive knowledge on how long your lifespan is.

**(Brute/Trump) No Pain, No Gain** 
Cost: 6 SP 
The more injured you are, the more powerful you become. You become stronger, faster, more durable, and react faster. This applies to your powers as well. You also possess a mild Brute power that keeps you standing even after your bones are broken. If you are on your last-minute stand, you could find yourself contesting an Endbringer in physical might with just an ordinary person's strength.
_Pain not Wasted_ 
Required:(Brute) Biological Redistribution 
When your heart is destroyed, you become insanely strong, but that strength disappears when it's healed. Not anymore, not while your still in the fight. When you obtain your boosts from your injuries, it won't disappear outright if they are healed, instead sticking with you throughout the the whole fight. 

**(Brute/Trump) Fame** 
Cost: 6 SP 
Your strength, durability, and overall physical power increase in direct proportion to the number of people who admire and feel loyal to you. This connection doesn’t need to be personal; widespread admiration from strangers, fans, or followers can empower you just as well as the devotion of close allies. 
When people express their admiration openly in your presence—through cheering, chanting, declarations of loyalty, or even acts of service or protection—the effect surges, providing a temporary boost in power. The surge lasts as long as the visible or vocal support continues. 
The effect favors quantity over quality. While one person’s complete devotion may be powerful, even overwhelming, two people with half that intensity will strengthen you more. A room full of people with modest admiration will outmatch a single die-hard follower. True power comes from building a wide base of support—being loved, admired, or idolized by the many rather than the few. The effect is strongest when admiration takes the form of cult-like devotion or parasocial obsession.
If you possess other powers, this admiration-fueled strength enhances them as well.

**(Brute/Trump) Fa Jin** 
Cost: 8 SP
You are now able to build up kinetic energy in your body through repetitive motions. This kinetic energy will give a red glow that brightens as more kinetic energy is stored. The kinetic energy can also be stored for later use. When you use this kinetic energy, you can choose to strengthen your body, increase your speed, or make yourself stronger, but it all depends on how much energy you’ve built up. There is, however, a limit on the amount of energy that you can output, as you cannot output more energy than would come out of a ballistic missile. 
You can also, if you have other powers, use your stored-up energy to boost them proportional to how much energy you have stored.

**(Brute/Trump) Power in Numbers**
Cost: 9 SP 
Your strength, durability, and abilities, as well as those of your allies, grow as the size of your group increases, though the effects are relatively modest in smaller numbers. With fewer than ten allies, the enhancement is barely noticeable, offering only minor boosts. The power becomes significant when the group grows to the hundreds, peaking in potency at around 500 individuals. At this point, each member’s abilities are amplified to nearly 20 times their original strength. Beyond this, the effects taper off, with diminishing returns, making additional members provide increasingly smaller contributions to the overall boost. 
This amplifies both physical capabilities and powers, scaling dynamically with the group’s composition. A fighter becomes faster and stronger, a healer more efficient, and powers gain increased range and intensity. 
The boost relies on both proximity and cohesion among group members, as each individual under its influence acts as a relay, extending the range of the effect. This creates a network where the amplification can spread across greater distances, provided the members remain within range of one another. However, the power offers no inherent coordination or unifying influence, leaving the group’s effectiveness entirely dependent on their ability to work together. If members become disorganized, scattered, or fail to align their efforts, the amplification weakens substantially, diminishing its overall potency and causing individuals to revert closer to their original strength.


**(Brute/Trump) Stockpile**
Cost: 10 SP
You naturally generate and store a unique form of energy over time. When you are resting or not engaging in physically strenuous activities, your energy generation rate increases. This stored energy can be used to strengthen your physical capabilities or amplify any other powers you possess. The energy reserves have no strict limit, allowing you to accumulate energy endlessly. However, as your stockpile grows larger, the rate at which you generate energy decreases, creating a soft limit on how much energy you can accumulate at any given moment.
At the peak of this soft limit, unleashing all of your stored energy grants you immense power, placing you just below the level of an Endbringer for a few minutes before your reserves are entirely depleted. Reaching this soft limit takes a minimum of one week under optimal conditions.
*Growing Stockpile*
Required: Power Stockpile
Your rate of energy generation now never lessens. It even increases the longer you don’t use any energy, with the rate of generation resetting once you do.

**(Brute/Trump) Zenkai Boost**
Cost: 10 SP
You can now grow stronger after recovering from an injury. This boost not only enhances your physical abilities but also amplifies the strength of all your other powers.
Minor injuries, such as small cuts or bruises, provide only a slight increase in power—typically just a few percentage points. More serious injuries, like broken bones or nonlethal traumatic wounds, can significantly boost your power by 50% to 75%. However, critical injuries, such as gunshot wounds, severe blood loss, or the loss of a limb, offer the most dramatic increase, multiplying your power by 3 to 5 times.
You also possess a moderate healing factor that ensures you recover to perfect health over time, helping you survive these injuries.
This healing factor allows broken bones to heal within a couple of weeks and missing limbs to regrow in a month or two. However, be warned: fatal injuries, such as decapitation or being stabbed through the heart, will still kill you. So, don’t fight recklessly your healing factor is not on the same level as Wolverine or Deadpool, at least not yet.

**(Trump/Brute) Madness**
Cost: 4 SP
At the cost of your logical thinking/planning, you gain a major boost to your physical capabilities and powers. Additionally, you gain a boost to your instincts, capable of “feeling” the most suitable development for oneself during combat. You become immune to short term precognition and analysis based thinker powers.
*Madman's Rampage*
Required:(Brute) Rampage
Incompatible: (Thinker) Clean Mind
When you gain your enhancement from Madness, your rage is also ignited, reaching what it was at its peak. Your rage now also makes your other powers stronger in the same way it enhances your physical abilities. Your instincts for combat are heightened even further, and thinker powers in general struggle to get a full grasp on you.

**(Trump) Loyal Companion**
Cost: 5 SP
You can select one person to be your Master. While this doesn't force you to follow their commands, you get stronger when you do so. This must come directly from them and recordings don't work. You can swap whoever is your Master whenever you want.

## (Trump/Brute) Twice Critical
**(Trump/Brute) Twice Critical**
Cost: 5 SP
You can temporarily double the strength of your body’s capabilities and your powers, you can also transfer this boost to another person. As a downside every exertion of stamina is twice as exhausting. How long the boosts last is tied to your stamina. When the boost is transferred to someone else you are still the one who pays the stamina cost for their actions while boosted.
[[#TRUMP UPGRADES/FUSION]]

**(Trump) Desperation**
Cost: 6 SP
When you're under extreme stress, exhaustion, or overwork, your powers magnify in strength, effectiveness, and overall control. It responds to your state of mind, gaining a considerable boost when you're not in the most ideal conditions. This boost grows if you have recently been or currently in the middle of combat.
*Plus Ultra*
Required:(Trump) Limit Break
When pushed to your limit, when you have exhausted all your tricks, when you have no strength in your limbs anymore, when faced with something far beyond you, you will feel an unexpected trickle of power. You can never falter or fall down. You will always have just a bit more strength and be able to push on just a bit more. Your powers will grow slowly; the worse the situation you are in, the greater they grow. While its growth in raw power is minimal, its growth in versatility is tremendous. Most of its growth will be aimed at assisting you in your current situation, prioritizing now without much consideration for the future.
*Push Beyond*
Required:(Trump) Limit Break
Required: I Hope It Haunts You
No longer do you only gain strength by standing by death’s doors; as you take the final step and are embraced by death, you will receive a boon.

Your body, once you have perished, will continue to stand, its powers strengthened to their peak. Much like any Master power you have, your body will act to avenge your death, becoming a ferocious beast puppeteering your remains. It will carry out any plan you may have before your death, but know that no matter what it does, it is not you. It is, at best, a shadow of what once was. If you had a regeneration-based power, you will be able to be revived after a while.

## (Trump) Ramp
**(Trump) Ramp**
Cost: 6 SP
The longer you use your powers, the more they ramp up. This could mean being physically stronger, firing projectiles faster, or even having a farther range. It ramps by 1.01 times its current power every second, to a max of 5 minutes for about 20 times it original power. If you stop using your powers for longer than 5 seconds then the ramp resets. This does not apply to passive powers.
[[#u]]

**(Trump) Active Combat**
Cost: 6 SP
By being in active combat, your abilities become stronger. The greater your involvement—whether by leading or facing strong opponents—the more your powers are boosted. This boost is dependent on what you are doing in combat, if you are directly fighting then you would get more raw power or sub powers to boost your main one. If you are leading or commanding others then the boosts will be more focused on versatility and support effects. This boost is removed once you leave combat. The boost can, at best, triple your power’s capabilities or strength, with this requiring you to be at the centre of the conflict.

## (Trump) Warcry
**(Trump) Warcry**
Cost: 7 SP
By explaining your current action, you get much stronger. Your powers will express themselves in a more controllable and powerful manner. The longer the chant more accurately defines it, the greater it expresses itself.
[[#TRUMP UPGRADES/FUSION]]

**(Trump) Limit Break**
Cost: 7 SP
It is possible to amplify your powers by pushing it past their limits, making them more potent and effective. However, doing so comes with significant consequences. As you continue to push your powers to greater heights, you will experience increased physical strain and pain. This could result in permanent damage to your body, making it more difficult to maintain and control your abilities. The increase in power is temporary, and it is recommended to not regularly use this power as the strain can kill you.


**(Trump) Growth Booster**
Cost: 8 SP
You may give either yourself or someone else an enhanced growth rate for one of their powers. The boosted power grows at a rate of 1 SP/week, up to a max of twice the original SP cost. It will grow based on the owner's actions and experiences, and will try to suit their needs similar to Dynamist Jr. Using the power on someone else requires both physical touch and consent. Each person can only have one growth booster at a time, and they may not have a power boosted if it has already been boosted to the limit. You may grant boosters to an unlimited amount of people, and can remove boosters at will.

## (Trump) Bodycount
**(Trump) Bodycount**
Cost: 9 SP
A counter exists in your mind, tracking the number of people you’ve killed. Every kill increases the counter by 1. For each increment of the counter, all your physical, mental, and other abilities increase by 1%. If the counter shows 2, your abilities are enhanced by 2%. If it reaches 10, you gain a 10% boost, and so on, with no upper limit to what you can achieve. Your power thrives on the destruction you sow, making every kill an investment in your own growth.
[[#TRUMP UPGRADES/FUSION]]

**(Trump) Quest**
Cost: 9 SP
You can give yourself quests, which function as self-imposed challenges. Completing these quests grants you rewards, usually in the form of growth, skill improvement, or improvements of any abilities you have. The difficulty of the quest determines the quality of the reward—trivial tasks provide little to no benefit, while significant challenges yield meaningful enhancements. You can have up to five active quests at a time, each with its own objective and potential reward.
While you can create repeatable quests, the rewards scale accordingly. Repeating simple actions, like taking steps, will offer minimal to no benefit, but sustained effort toward meaningful goals—such as practicing a skill for a set amount of time—will grant better rewards. The nature of the rewards aligns with the quest completed.
You can abandon or replace quests at any time.

**(Trump/Brute) Looks Matter**
Cost: 15 SP
Appearances matter, and your power takes this literally. The better you look the stronger you get, both your physical strength and the strength of your powers. This factors in both your physical appearance and the appearance of your clothing and powers, so a fancy and artistic spread of lasers would be more effective than simply drowning an opponent in firepower.
Furthermore, the general theme of your appearance can also influence minor aspects of your powers or even grant minor powers of their own. This effect also scales with the appearance and quality of your outfit. For instance, a low quality wind or avian themed outfit might allow you to fall slower or make your Mover powers go faster, while an extremely high quality fire costume could grant decently powerful pyrokinesis.
This pairs extremely well with Tinker powers, especially (Tinker) Style, as normal materials and crafting methods alone are not enough to reach the highest levels of this power.


**(Trump) Gamer System**
Cost: 20 SP
Your Shard grants you access to a game-like system to manage your power(s). By default, you have access to a basic system which includes attributes and the ability to grow by gaining experience. You gain experience by completing quests or defeating enemies (does not need to involve killing them) and can increase your attributes by training. How the system works in details depends on the Shard, two people with this power can have systems that work differently.
All other powers you select interface through this one and unlock their ability to grow. As you use them, your powers will grow in strength and will unlock new aspects.
Your growth potential is not unlimited, however. Your Shard can only support a certain amount of total progression. This limit will be communicated to you.
*Unlimited Power*
Required: Negentropy, Negentropy, or Shardless
You are no longer limited in growth, however powers become exponentially harder to grow the stronger they are.

**(Trump/Thinker) Feast**
Cost: 20 SP
In your eyes, all Parahumans and power effects (including yourself) around you have an energy pool inside them; the stronger the powers, the more energy they contain. The longer you look at this energy, the more you know about the power, initially gaining one to two-word generalizations like "Awareness" or "Heat Generation". As you look more, you start to know things like "Always On" or "Needs Touch". Look long enough, and you will know everything about a power, including its weaknesses and applications. Seeing the power in action increases the speed at which you acquire knowledge about it.

With a touch, you can drain that energy; it takes longer to totally drain the more energy there is; draining a power effect will weaken it until it ceases to exist, and draining a parahuman will undermine their power to the point it’s obsolete and they aren’t capable of using it. You can drain energy at range and affect multiple targets, but it's slower than using touch, becoming even slower with distance, and the more targets you are draining simultaneously. With time, a parahuman will regain their power; the longer it takes, the stronger the power is. You can also do the opposite, being able to transfer the energy you collected. The same rules for touch and range from draining apply to transference, which allows you to use your capacity to boost and create new aspects of powers that aren't yours.

You can expend energy to temporarily boost part of a power. Like increasing range, decreasing the time necessary to do something, or giving a new aspect to it. ¼ of that boost becomes permanent; a power that temporarily gained 6 meters to its range now has permanently an additional 1.50 (or one and a half) meters to its range. If you temporarily gave (Trump) Eidolon an extra slot, you would permanently have it but only be able to slot powers that are ¼ the strength.

Creating new aspects will cost more energy than boosting an existing one and will cost more the more it deviates from the theme and mechanics of the power, new aspects take more energy to boost compared to the base power. Giving your Water Manipulation the capacity to see the future by looking at water would take much less energy than giving your Earth Manipulation precognition while giving your Water Manipulation the capacity to control Ice would take even less energy.

Any powers you enhance will start releasing electricity-like energy or a glow when they are used. This energy/glow happens either on the power itself or on the part of your body where it originates from. Sometimes both happen to either.
This power is best used in bursts to conserve the stockpiled energy and because continuous use won't keep increasing the permanent boost. Powers affected by Feast cannot affect Feast.


**(Brute/Trump) Anu**
Cost: 25 SP
Your power is a conceptual fusion of both Lung and Eidolon. That is to say, your power continually ramps up through raging conflict which grants you new temporary powers. Then again, it isn't to say you can surely exploit it with nothing as even outside of combat your baseline grants you a low-level Alexandria package comparable to Glory Girl’s alongside an additional low-level blaster power in similar potency to Lady Photon.

As your power ramps up, your baseline continuously grows next to your invulnerability branching out from general durability and adaptively developing immunities to the parahuman effects you’re battling against or alongside, your Brute and Blaster powers will similarly gain an adaptive diversity to be more formidable against powers you are contending on the fight’s both sides for any eventuality, while your flight speed continuously increases, your mind simultaneously improving to perceive and function at your constantly dashing speed and growth rate.

During this escalation, you’ll temporarily develop powers meant to aid you amidst your battles. Depending on the circumstance, these powers can fluctuate from solely meant for combat i.e. a striker power meant to disintegrate what you touch, to utility-based powers i.e. a Thinker power focusing on target location. The powers’ growth rate is naturally equivalent to your baseline powers, though developing new powers will delay your growth rate.

Finally, you can affect your growth rate. Like Lung, you are capable of charging up in anticipation of a fight to accelerate your ramping up, yet, unlike Lung, you are fully capable of beginning to ramp up outside of battle, although it would be extremely slow on top of only capable of reaching a mid-level Brute and Blaster for your baseline. Additionally, this control over your growth rises in effectiveness in combat, being able to “steer” it in certain directions e.g. from focusing on escalating your invulnerability to directing it to develop a new power to assist you.

*Escalating God*
Required: (Trump) Queen of Escalation
Your power's adaptations are now permanent, while still following the rules of your power and the need to ramp up into total immunity. At their base level, they make you resistant to those powers.
Additionally, powers that you gain throughout ramping up now become permanent. Yet, your additional powers can be strongest when non-ramped up is equivalent to a high T1 power.


**(Trump) Heart Is An Awesome Power**
Cost: 20 SP
You can modify/boost your powers through weird logic as long as it makes sense and you can justify it. The new effect is capped at half the SP of the power or 10 SP, whichever is higher. A power can only have one of those effects at a time, though you can freely change it to something else or discard the effect to return the power to normal.

You could, for example, bypass the Manton Limit on your Water Manipulation power by thinking that you should logically be able to manipulate someone's blood because Water is Water, or you could reinterpret the capacity to manipulate Fire as the manipulation of Heat itself and thus be able to freeze stuff by removing their heat.
*Troll Logic*
Required:(Trump) Art of Symbolism
Through your Shard’s understanding of human culture and ability to manifest effects based on it, you have jailbroken your hard limitation on how much a power can be boosted or modified. Now, so long as you can find some form of logic - no matter how complex or bizarre - to make it make sense in your head, you can have your powers act in any way you see fit. There is one caveat however; unless you take Esoteric Knowledge or Shardless you are still restricted to things Shards are capable of.

**(Brute/Trump) Criminality**
Cost: 20 SP
Whenever you commit a crime or break a law your everything is enhanced. Skills, powers, body, and etc. The greater the crime the bigger the boost, with the severity and context diminishing or increasing said boost.
As such, you could gleefully murder a innocent person and receive a 50% boost, or jaywalk and receive a 1% boost.
The laws that are used are the ones from wherever you were born and the location you are in.

**(Breaker/Trump) Golden Form**
Cost: 30 SP
You’ve gained the ability to change into a powerful breaker form, converting your body into semi-solid/liquid energy, with its initial form resembling you in a full-body cloak of golden flames. All your abilities are massively enhanced from your previous form. A normal human would be capable of overpowering Alexandria in strength and durability, sheer speed to run from one side of the planet to the other in a minute, and a reaction time to easily handle that kind of speed. This enhancement is extended to all your abilities, including other powers. The breaker form can be confined to a single part or individual parts of your body if you wish, and switching between your normal form and breaker form will instantly heal any injury.
Alongside this is the ability to manipulate the energy your body is made from, allowing you to freely shape it into whatever you desire such as massive hands, a large animal form, or even weapons. The energy your body produces and is made from can be expelled as powerful blasts or used to imbue any other abilities you possess to further enhance them. You can channel any abilities you possess through your energy form as if they were your own body. You also possess a secondary ability allowing you unlimited multitasking in regards to your energy form.
You cannot access any of the abilities from the form without using your Breaker form and can choose to change the colors of your breaker form at will. The transformation between forms is instantaneous.

*Golden Dragon*
Required:Dragon of Kyushu
Your inner dragon shines with an immeasurable golden light.

Your Golden Form’s energy mutates and enhances Dragon of Kyushu far more than it would normally.
Due to the malleable nature of your Golden Form carrying over to your Draconic Power, you can now intentionally call up any mutation and alterations that you had previously undergone, able to freely shift your form from normal to the greatest heights you have ever reached and anywhere in between at will.
Moreover by entering your Golden Form in of itself, alongside the normal enhancement you would typically have, you can now choose to consciously direct some or all of your enhancements and alterations, also able to freely shape the form as you normally would your energy form.
You still gain 10% of each escalation to your base form as normal, but this now also includes the height of power you reach with Golden Form enhancing it.


**(Trump) Jailbreak**
Cost: 40 SP
You’ve gained the ability to access and control the abilities of others and yourself in a broad but imprecise manner.
This will allow you to remove restrictions, enhance abilities, alter them in broad strokes, and more. However this comes with inherent risks, one that must be carefully managed lest it kill it their wielder’s, and more importantly you.
The power works through touch and line of sight.

The power works through three major methods. Power Amplification, Aspect Infusion, and Category Expansion.

<font color="#ffff00">Power Amplification</font> is the simplest method, through which you simply amplify the powers existing aspects. For example a telekinetic would be able to generate significantly more force and/or possess much more fine control.

<font color="#ffff00">Category Expansion</font> allows you to add additional capabilities to the power expression directly, allowing it to manifest new features. For example by adding a Master component to a pyrokinetic power it could allow the user to create sentient fire constructs.

<font color="#ffff00">Aspect Infusion</font> adds new aspects to the theme of a power, creating a new dimension to the overall power. For example by adding an aspect of weakening to a Trump focused on amplifying others, it could allow them to instead directly attack others by striping them of strength instead of enhancing them. This can also be used to remove specific limitations such as the Manton limit.

These alterations can only be chosen in a broad manner, how many times it affects someone, how potent the effects are, and what categories and aspects are added, but the specifics on how these amplifications manifest are uncontrollable.
Each modification carries inherent risks that escalate with proximity of each successive alterations. For Power Amplification, a quintupling of the power’s potency can be considered enough to hit the end requirements of the first phase, with the multiplier’s maximum to hit the next phase doubling for each additional phase.

The first phase, the <font color="#ffff00">initial alteration</font>, will typically result in no alteration to the mechanics of the powers.

For the second phase, <font color="#ffff00">Trigger Happy</font>, the power will start to activate on its own at times.
This can lead to unforeseen and potentially disastrous consequences, there aren’t many things one can say to explain why while in their civilian identity their heat vision activated all of a sudden and eviscerated a swath of innocents.

For the third phase, <font color="#ffff00">Instinct Erosion</font>, normally instinctive control over powers is lost.
The user will need conscious effort to preform actions that were once reflexive. Brute powers that enhance your strength may have you accidentally ripping the arm off of someone you tried to shake the hand of, and powers that require a high degree of precision will be a nightmare to deal with.

For the fourth phase, <font color="#ffff00">Protection Nullification</font>, inherent safeguards are stripped away,
This greatly increases the risk of self harm or unintended consequences in the environment. This can result in your own powers burning you, cutting you, potentially backfiring in a permanently damaging if not lethal manner.

For the fifth phase, <font color="#ffff00">Volatile Surge</font>, results in the powers becoming incredibly volatile, risking catastrophic failure and complete loss of control.
One progresses through each phase for each successive alteration within three months of the previous one, and will drop to the previous phase if one manages to avoid further alterations within three months.

Each phase also doubles the power’s potency without counting towards the phase’s alteration threshold, this increase in power is permanent.

The fifth phase, Volatile Surge, is repeated for each subsequent alteration after the fifth if it falls within the three month period, becoming increasingly unstable and chaotic the more alterations there are.
The effects of each phase, except for Volatile Surge, can be partially mitigated with rigorous and focused training, but only by managing to get to a lower phase or out of the phases can the drawbacks be completely eliminated.

If one manages to drop to a lower phase or out of the phase entirely you can improve upon their power again. In the same manner, allowing you to continuously improve their abilities.
Be warned however that shard powers can be burned out by this, as the shard will need to reveal more and more power to its host, and potentially burn an incredible amount of energy to create new features.
This drawback is removed if you are Negentropic/Shardless, and will allow you to use your own energy source to make their improvements and/or share the secret to Negentropy with their power source if you wish.

## TRUMP UPGRADES/FUSION 
**Immortal Godly Demonic Jade Emperor Chant of the Seven Heavenly Providence Divine Samsara Buddha of 1000 Virtues and Sins™**
Cost: 8 SP
Required: [[#(Trump) Warcry]]
*Darkness blacker than black and darker than dark,
I beseech thee, combine with my deep crimson.
The time of awakening cometh.
Justice, fallen upon the infallible boundary,
appear now as an intangible distortions!
I desire for my torrent of power a destructive force:
a destructive force without equal!
Return all creation to cinders,
and come frome the abyss!
Explosion!*

Through the use of chants and exaggerated gestures, you can dramatically enhance any ability or skill you possess. The longer and more exaggerated the chant and performance, the greater the boost. For example, if you're solving math problems, delivering a grand, over-the-top chant while striking dynamic poses will amplify your calculative abilities to an extraordinary level, allowing you to process complex equations with superhuman speed and precision. There is no limit to how strong it can get, just how long of a chant you can say and how much you can exaggerate your gestures.

**AAAARRRRGGGHHH!!!**
Cost: 3 SP
Required:(Trump) Warcry
You have unlocked your inner barbarian—your powers now surge with the sheer volume and passion of your shout. By roaring your intent, you amplify both control and strength, each word shaping the effect based on your action. A powerful yell like “Crush!” intensifies your physical force, while a fierce “Pierce!” hones precision and focus. The louder and more passionately you shout, the greater the boost, making your powers sharper, stronger, and more focused. Longer, more detailed warcries create complex effects, such as “Shield against all harm!” to reinforce your defenses. You can also get more basic, giving a raw, general increase simply by wordlessly screaming

**Oh It’s Personal Now**
Cost: 3 SP
Required:[[#(Trump) Bodycount]] (9 SP)
By delving into the lives of your targets, your counter’s gains grow exponentially. A normal kill still adds just 1 point to the counter, but if you take the time to learn about them—such as their name, where they lived, their daily habits, or who they loved—the points gained increases exponentially. The more knowledge you have, the greater the increase. Knowledge is literally power for you to reap, and the more intimate your understanding of a life extinguished, the stronger you become.

**Multiplicative Growth**
Cost: 6 SP
Required:(Trump) Bodycount
Instead of a flat increase, your power now grows multiplicatively with each kill. If a kill increases your counter by 1, your abilities increase by 1%, but each new increase compounds on top of the last. If you have the Worthy Prey upgrade, this effect also applies to the points gained per kill—meaning a kill that grants 100 points would double your current power.

**Worthy Prey**
Cost: 3 SP
Required:(Trump) Bodycount
Your counter no longer treats all lives as equal. A normal kill still grants just 1 point, but the stronger your victim, the greater the reward. Power, skill, and resilience all factor into the gain—those who stand above the average grant exponentially more. A veteran or a cape will each be worth more than a common bystander. The truly exceptional—those whose strength shapes the world around them—can yield dozens or even hundreds of points upon their demise. This scales based on what is considered “average” strength, so if on average everyone (including civilians) is a Brute 1 then killing a Brute 1 will still only give 1 Point


**Fist of the King of Worlds**
Cost: 5 SP
Required:[[#(Trump/Brute) Twice Critical]] (5 SP)
You can double your power, but that isn't your limit. At will, you can go even further. triple, quadruple... There's no telling how high you can go now.

Although your strength, power, senses, etc. is multiplied as high as you want, each level gives an equal level of strain, your stamina drains even faster, and your body starts to tear itself apart. Your muscles start to rip, your bones creak, and your nerves are screaming.
But it's not all bleak though. By training your body to become stronger, your body can tolerate higher and higher levels of this ability, but there is a slow, but undeniable level of diminishing returns.
If you stay at just the first level though, you will only experience the normal level of stamina usage.


**Dragon of Kyushu**
Cost: 16 SP
Required: (Brute) Lung, or Kenta (9 SP)
You are a dragon that thrives on combat, your enemies shuddering at the thought of you and your power. You now escalate exponentially faster as you grow in strength, i.e. as you get stronger you grow in power faster and faster.

Your Escalation now also affects all your other powers and your specific defenses, getting hit with poison will give you a poison resistance which will then begin to escalate with you, the power will also begin to very slowly lift your other powers' weaknesses, with this rate of improvement will be accelerated if those weaknesses are specifically targeted during combat.
You permanently gain 10% of the power you had during the height of your most recent escalation after you return to your base state, this 10% is counted for each stat/power individually, this also means that every transformation/escalation will give you an increase in overall power no matter how small.

You stay in your Escalated state for up to 2 hours with no conflict unless you willingly transform back. Your size will grow in equal measure with your power, however, once you reach a certain size, around the size of Lung when he fought Leviathan, you will be able to choose whether or not you continue to grow. The growth can also be evolved out or adapted to make you only grow when you want to (if that's something you wish to happen) while being a slow change like all other power enhancements.
*New Age Dragon*
Required:(Breaker/Blaster) Biological Dynamo
After the decimation visited upon Japan by the atomic bombs the psychological scars carved upon their population began to shown in their art, their stories, most notably shown in the Godzilla.
Your shard seems to have taken inspiration from it, your powerful draconic form while possessing its more traditional features has mutated and evolved, influenced by your Biological Dynamo power.
By drawing upon your store of energy you can greatly enhance the speed at which you mutate, able to explosively enhance yourself and take a more direct hand as to what your mutations and enhancements are.
Moreover even without drawing upon your energy stores, your form seems to draw in ambient energy to enhance itself, every blast of lightning, every strike, every searing conflagration intended to incinerate you seems to not only not find any proper purchase upon you, nor does it merely direct your enhancements but instead it seems to directly feed your power and bring you to new heights.


**Boosted Gear**
Cost: 8 SP
Required:(Trump/Brute) Twice Critical (5 SP)
Required:(Shaker) Amped Up
Required:(Trump) Limit Break
Required: Vital, Noble, or Shardless
Twice Critical’s functionality has evolved through synergy with your abilities to amplify your surroundings and push past your limitations.

You no longer have a hard limit on how many times you can double your strength, instead your limit is a soft-cap set by your baseline strength, the stronger you are as a baseline, the more boosts you can withstand. You can even go beyond your cap, although doing so causes strain on you which scales with how far past your limits you are. The stamina cost from boosting scales with how many times you’ve boosted. Transferring boosts to others still draws the stamina costs from you, however other beings have their own limits and going past those causes strain to them not you, so don’t give your allies more than they can handle.

Your capability to transfer boosts has also grown. You can now double specific properties, even those of inanimate objects or phenomena. Double a sword’s sharpness, a shield’s durability, a fire’s heat, or a laser’s power. This is not subject to Amped Up’s limitation of one property per target and you can even spread out a boost across multiple attributes, although the end result is still capped at double the original state. Objects have their own limits based on their quality, however due to their nature they don’t incur much of a stamina cost. You can also spread out a boost across multiple targets to not overwhelm them.

To give a sense of scale, using multiple boosts on a single property allows you to do things like turning a simple lighter into a conflagration capable of slagging metal and torching entire buildings. Be wary however, as continuous boosting can quickly drain your Shard’s reserves if the boosts get big enough, although Negentropy or Shardless render this a non-issue.
*Juggernaut Drive*
Required:(Brute) Lung
Your baseline boost softcap scales greater than before, and as your draconic transformation reaches higher and higher levels, your softcap continues to rise while the stamina cost from boosting scales slower. In simpler terms, the more your transformation progresses, the more you can boost and the less it costs to boost. The strength you can gain from this is such that you could fight non-sandbagging Endbringers on even ground and fight entire armies of parahumans with contemptuous ease

**Unlimited POWAAAAHHHH!**
Cost: 6 SP
Required:[[#(Trump) Ramp]]
Required:Real Pumped
You now possess the ability to amplify your strength and powers up to 50 times their normal levels, both physically and in terms of any active or passive abilities. This ramp-up requires about 5 minutes to reach full strength. To activate this boost, you must either be actively using your power or engaged in combat.

If you activate this boost by using your power outside of a fight, only active abilities will be enhanced; passive powers won’t receive the boost. In this mode, you must maintain continuous use of the power, as any break longer than 5 seconds will reset the boost.

However, if you engage in combat, both active and passive abilities will continue to ramp up for as long as you remain in the fight, steadily increasing until you reach the full 50-fold enhancement. The boost ends only when combat is fully over, allowing you to unleash your maximum potential throughout the encounter.
*Lung Wannabe*
Required:(Trump) Active Combat
In combat, your powers have no upper limit on how high they can grow. The rate of your power amplification accelerates in response to the strength, numbers, and intensity of your opponents. The stronger or more numerous your foes, the faster you ramp up, allowing you to adapt quickly and push your abilities beyond prior limits. Your base level will never go below 50 times in 5 minutes.


# OTHER TRUMP POWERS (SHARDLESS, EMPOWERING)

### Physical Powers

**Homebred Homunculus**
Cost: 10 SP
You are not a natural human, but an artificial construct; a homunculus created in the image of mankind through alchemy, arcane science, or advanced synthesis. Every part of your body is an engineered imitation of human biology, optimized and stabilized to exceed the flaws of natural life. You look and act human, but your body does not age, mutate, or degrade like theirs. You are a living replica designed to surpass the species you were modeled after.

Your baseline physical and mental performance is over twice that of an average human across all categories. You are stronger, faster, more durable, and more precise. You can lift weights that would crush a human’s bones, endure impacts that would kill a normal body, and maintain peak performance for hours without fatigue. Your cognitive structure is equally enhanced, capable of perfect recall, rapid pattern recognition, and complex multitasking without loss of focus.

You are naturally talented in any learned skill. Your synthetic neural architecture is optimized for adaptive mastery, allowing you to learn and refine techniques at a fraction of the normal time. If a human needs years of training to reach expert level in a discipline, you require only one. This includes magic or supernatural skills if you either personally have it or if it exists in your setting.
The biggest thing is how your body is built specifically to hold any powers you have in the CYOA. This strengthens those powers by a whole magnitude and gives you preprogrammed instincts for higher-leveled uses of them, making growth easier and stronger. Every part of your body is adapted to house and refine them. For example, if you have Chakra (Naruto), your body is built to perfectly regulate, refine, and circulate it. Your artificial chakra coils are denser and more efficient than human ones, allowing you to store far more chakra and recover it much faster. Your control is instinctively on the level of Tsunade, and advanced techniques like the Rasengan or nature transformation come naturally. Techniques that normally require years of training are reduced to months, and your chakra output scales several times higher than human limits. As you grow stronger, your body continuously optimizes itself to handle more power, automatically reinforcing your chakra network and sharpening your instinctive control. The stronger your chakra becomes, the more perfectly your body evolves to wield it.

**Natural Born Destroyer (One Piece)**
Cost: 20 SP
You’re a genetic anomaly, a freak of nature, born fundamentally different from the rest of your species. No one knows how or why. You just are.
Your body defies natural limits. From the moment you open your eyes, you're brimming with power. You grow faster, bigger, and stronger than anyone around you. Your skin is tougher than steel, your teeth harder than stone, as your strength keeps multiplying with age.
But it doesn't stop at the physical. Spiritually and magically, you're the outlier that every system wasn’t built to handle. You break through barriers meant only for the “chosen ones.” Abilities that are supposed to be one-in-a-million — like Conqueror’s Haki or god-tier spiritual pressure — well, you were born with them. Nothing is truly beyond grasp because it will simply come naturally to you.
In time, you’ll undoubtedly rise to the top of your universe, untouchable by nearly all. The only threats left will be your own ego and the limits you choose not to break.



## Esoteric and Abstract 


**Dungeon Maker**
Cost: 20 SP
At will, you can open permanent portals to endless dungeons. You may at any time close a portal no matter the distance, this can be done by setting a mental timer or be done at will. Not just infinite in size, these dungeons are filled with monsters, traps, and loot that respawns regularly, growing deadlier and more valuable the farther you stray form the entrance. You may determine the danger level of the new dungeon's entry area each time you create a portal, from 'dangerous to an unarmed, average teenager' to 'dangerous to you, with all your powers'. Every dungeon always offers up at least one means of permanently empowering an adventurer, granting them skills, powers, enhanced attributes, and more. Those that die inside a dungeon make it stronger and deadlier for as long as their souls are not retrieved.

*Instant Dungeon*
Required:Tower Lost in Time
Required:Gamer System
On top of its original abilities, your Dungeon Maker power now has the full scope of Han Jihan's Instant Dungeon (ID) Skill from 'The Gamer' manwha, alongside being able to add more customizability options later down the line as you level up.

*Mystery Dungeon*
Required:Pokémon (Pokemon)
You now gain the ability to have Dungeon Maker create Mystery Dungeons as per the namesake Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games.  
These dungeons possess many floors filled with hostile Pokémon, traps, and, most importantly, useful items. The items you can gain within these Mystery Dungeons include items from the mainline Pokémon games and Mystery Dungeon games.  
  
This includes simple money in the form of gold coins, various beneficial consumable items that include ones that can heal you, keep you fed and healthy, increase your power permanently, or unlock new powers. Various wearable equipment, such as species-specific ones able to raise your power as much as 3 times and grant other helpful effects, special belts, special ribbons, and glasses with various special vision buffs.  
The deeper you delve into these Mystery Dungeons, the greater your rewards; however, so too will the danger and difficulty increase. Should you explore carefully, you may find special rooms with rare and powerful items. Also, delve deep enough and you discover Mythical and Legendary Pokémon who will fight you, and should you win, may offer a boon.  
  
Lastly, you gain a safety net in that should you be able to die, you will instead black out and be kicked out of the dungeon you are currently in. Then a cooldown will initiate with a duration based on the depth you were in the dungeon. This cooldown can vary from one day to as long as a month at max.

**This isn't even my final form**
Cost: 25 SP
You now have the ability to take on a series of immensely powerful transformed states of your own design, with the first one giving a 10x boost to all your powers and physical stats, and the others after that offering a 10x boost to the previous form. These transformations could take a myriad of themes and appearances that follow them, maybe you want to look more animalistic or more regal, have a more monstrous theme etc, you can choose and design each form provided it follows your transformation's theme.
Note, that each form drains stamina and the stronger the form is the more stamina it drains and if not careful, could kill you, this can be mitigated through training.
You start with your first form and can unlock more in the future through training or a sudden boost of extreme emotion such as rage.

**Upgrade**
Cost: 25 SP
You possess the ability to upgrade anything—whether it's powers, items, spells, or even abstract concepts. You can choose to enhance an entire thing at once or focus on individual aspects, upgrading them one at a time. The more powerful or complex the thing is, the greater the effort and resources required to upgrade it.

To perform an upgrade, whether for an entire item or just specific aspects, you will need materials, time, effort, or even more abstract resources like lifeforce or rare items. The more powerful or obscure the thing you wish to upgrade, the more difficult the requirements will be. However, nothing will be impossible to upgrade—just harder to achieve or gather in terms of materials. For example, if you wanted to upgrade Excalibur, aspect by aspect, the types of materials required would remain consistent, but the quantity, energy, and time needed would increase as Excalibur is already an extremely powerful weapon.

You will have access to an upgrade tree, which will show the aspects you can enhance and the results of those upgrades. Keep in mind, each time you upgrade something, it will alter future options in the tree. Additionally, you can roll back an upgrade, returning the item to its original state and recovering half of the resources you used. However, this rollback feature comes at a cost, so use it wisely.
With time, effort, and the right materials, there is nothing you can’t upgrade. You can even choose to upgrade yourself or others. Starting as an ordinary human (or whatever you are), you could enhance your strength, power, and other attributes until you become a multiversal entity—and possibly beyond. But achieving such a transformation would require vast resources and time. This power also has the potential to mutate or change anything it upgrades, meaning the final result may differ from what you initially expect. To really get the most use out of this power the user must be creative.

**Gambler’s Intuition**
Cost: 15 SP
In your soul, there is a gambling machine. At the start, the chances of you getting a jackpot is 1 in 100000, but with every roll the chances double. You cannot make a roll while a roll is already in progress. The time needed to complete a roll is based on its current success rate (if there is a 1 in 100000 chance of getting a jackpot, then the time needed to complete the roll is 1/100 of a second, if there is a 1 in 50000 chance of getting a jackpot, then the time needed to complete the roll is 1/50 of a second.)
When you get a jackpot, all your capabilities are greatly boosted, up to nearly a 100 times. The duration is based on the roll’s success rate (if there is a 1 in 100000 chance of getting a jackpot, then the duration is 10 minutes, if there is a 1 in 50000 chance of getting a jackpot, then the duration is 5 minutes.)
While you have a jackpot, you cannot roll.

**The Tutorial Boss**
Cost: 5 SP

You are a BOSS! Okay, well, the one the hero beats at the start to get a hang of things. But that's ok, it's not a matter of how big your health bar is, it's how you use it!  
First things first, you're just stronger then the average in every aspect. Stronger, tougher, smarter, etc. Unlike other Joes' though, you don't buckle to damage like them. Even if a hole is blown clean through your stomach, you can still stand and fight, presuming you live afterwards.  
You also have second phase that activates when you're severely damaged, or 40% HP in game terms. Your second phase will see you being 15% stronger in every aspect, powers included. You also get a one-shot protection, where no single attack can make you dip below 40%. Although, once you reach that number, it's fair game. You also get a visual signifier when you are, perhaps glowing hair and eyes, or a red aura. It won't give any advantages, but it will look cool.  
You also gain a copy of the power system of the world you are in, becoming above average in that aspect, provided you are compatible with the system and can use it. Make sure you show that hero how to really use the power system!  
You also have an exceptional ability to lead, ensure loyalty to your goons, and recruit new ones.


## Foundation

**Gamer System**
Cost: 20 SP

You gain access to a game-like system to manage your power(s). By default, you have access to a basic system that includes attributes and the ability to grow by gaining experience. You gain experience by completing quests or defeating enemies (does not need to involve killing them) and can increase your attributes by training. How the system works in details depends on the user, you can either create a custom gamer system for yourself or choose a version from any franchise/fictional work you know, gaining all its features, (note that you can not use this to gain an Instant dungeon) two people with this power can have systems that work differently.  
This power will interface with other abilities you choose. As you use them, they will grow in strength and will unlock new aspects. While your growth is not limited, the stronger an ability is the harder it will be to improve it.

*Dynamic System*
Required:Dynamist Jr.
Gamer System is trumped by Dynamist Jr.  
It will get new features and improvements over time, but cannot affect Dynamist Jr. in return.
*Gamer²*
Required:(Trump) Gamer System
Your Gamer Systems have fused, requiring far less experience than normal with a greater range of evolutions. It's as if they compounded on each other, you can not only grow but can predict your powers and skill evolutions to plan ahead. You can even stockpile and spend experience on skills even if you haven't used them. This allows you to level up powers that have a harder time being used.
*Voice of the Gamer*
Required:Voice of the World (Tensura)
The Gamer System and Voice of the World have merged. Allowing you to gain skills from the Voice of the World and level them up through The Gamer. This allows you to level each skill gained from 1 to 100 before evolving the skill to a higher tier outside of the normal tiers of Voice of the World. In addition, the speed by which you gain skills and experience towards your level and skills has been increased slightly.
*The System Store*
Required:Multiversal Marketplace
Your Gamer System has been transformed by The Multiverse Marketplace, granting you access to both a regular marketplace and a unique Marketplace created by Gamers for Gamers. You can explore the standard Multiverse Marketplace alongside the Physical Gamer Marketplace, where you can sell your items and purchase new ones. Within the System Tab, you can also sell products specifically tailored for gamers. The Physical Gamer Marketplace is a safe zone free from violence, offering a variety of items crafted by gamers, including skills, powers, unique weapons, exclusive tech, different races and even pets and companions.  
The System Tab is managed by a helpful and cheerful AI that ensures you find whatever you desire—chances are it’s available in the System Store.  
Additionally, there is a hidden feature within the Gamer System called the Module Store. This store focuses on new Gamer System expansions in the form of tabs, which can be purchased using various types of Gamer Currency. Some modules include the Crafter Module, which centers on a crafting system, along with others like Alchemy, Blacksmithing, and Spell Crafting. There are even fictional modules, such as Star Wars, which grant you access to the Force. The possibilities for expansion within the Module Store are virtually limitless.
*Nemesis System*
Required:The Tutorial Boss
Your Gamer System interfaces with your nature as a Tutorial Boss, transforming into a Nemesis system. You are no longer just a hurdle for heroes to overcome – instead becoming an ever-evolving adversary, incapable of being permanently defeated. When you fall, you awaken later, at the cost of a significant portion of your accumulated experience. Each resurrection also hardens you, granting increased stats and resistance to what previously killed you.  
The title of a Tutorial Boss also provides a flat +10% to all stats (for a total of +25% when under 40% hp) and to your XP gain that gets stronger as your boss rank increases.  
To cap it all off, as you gain levels and grow stronger, your boss rank increases, beginning as the Tutorial Boss and advancing to the ranks of First Real Boss, Midgame Boss, and beyond. With each new rank, your inherent bonuses become even more potent, amplifying your stats and ensuring that your presence is always felt.
*The Restaurant System*
Required:The Humble Merchant
Required: Cooking By The Book, (Tinker/Trump) Gourmet, or (Thinker/Master) Chef Supreme
Required: Homecoming, or World-Walker
You gain access to a restaurant that exists within a pocket dimension, connected to the entire Multiverse. You can enter it at will and have complete control over its appearance both interior and exterior and can change it at any time.
You can open doors to any world known to you from any source, or make it completely random. As the owner, you have the absolute authority to deny entry or forcibly expel anyone. Within its walls, all guests are perpetually safe.
The restaurant is fully equipped with every tool you need to prepare any dish. If you require additional tools in the future, they will be generated automatically. The facility is self-cleaning and can expand or shrink as necessary to accommodate any number of guests.

You gain access to a store, allowing you to purchase ingredients from across the Multiverse, with all currencies converted automatically.
You also gain the ability to create clones possessing all your skills and abilities to help manage both your restaurant and the store.

If you have Merchant of Myth Upgrade customers can pay using esoteric or conceptual goods and if you have Traveling Merchant Add-On: Your store and restaurant can merge into any configuration you choose.

UPGRADES

**Debugger Console**
Cost: 20 SP
Required: Gamer System, or (Trump) Gamer System

You can access the inner workings of your system(s?) through the Debugger Console. This special window grants you access to the source code and assets that run the Gamer System. The language used is unknown to you unless you have code-related powers or skills. Modifications you do through the console happen in real-time and your system will glitch out if your code has bugs. Thankfully, there is a version control system built in so you can save your modifications and revert to an earlier state if you wish.  
While you can modify the inner workings of the system and are able to change the rules, you cannot modify your player data directly and are still limited by some rules. The level of freedom you have with your modifications depends on how strong you are.
*Superuser*
Required:Shard-Like
Required:Code Caster
Your expertise in handling the system’s source code reaches the kernel, your modification now can range to a complete overhaul of the system’s mechanics, and you can code just about any feature by programming it within the system. This results in the jailbreaking of the system itself.
*Editor UI*
Required:Toolbar (Animator vs Animation)
Your Toolbar has granted you access to the Editor Subsystem, which takes the form of any 3D editor of your choice and can be customized to suit your preferences. This subsystem gives you complete control over your Powers and Skills, allowing you to reshape their mechanics and forms like clay. It even enables you to create entirely new powers and skills, though with certain limitations. For instance, you must design any new power from scratch, and unfortunately, you cannot grant these powers to yourself instantly. While the Gamer System can create things from nothing, it doesn’t allow you to gain everything without effort. The stronger the power you design, the more challenging the conditions for acquiring it will be.

**Guild Master**
Cost: 20 SP
Required: Gamer System, or (Trump) Gamer System

You now have a Guild connected to your system, which is located inside a pocket dimension for your own use. You can use it to invite people you know to be with you, Guild also grants a system for each person that you invite into your Guild, letting them have unlimited potential, eventually surpassing any limits they had before.  
Your Guild is anchored to you and your system, and thus can be brought with you to any place you've been to. Inside the pocket dimension, you can adjust the flow of time by anywhere from 10% to 1000%, individually for each room. It also has a wide array of other functions and benefits that you could need for your day-to-day needs, and even entertainment of any non-supernatural variety you would want for there to be.  
Your Guild also has levels of its own as well, which can be increased by members both pooling their own resources into it and through just plain hard work: As your guild grows in levels, it will not only grow in size and complexity, but gain new abilities and refine old ones.

**Game World**
Cost: 5 SP
Required: Gamer System, or (Trump) Gamer System
Required:Idle Trainer
Required:Class Change

When you sleep, you gain access to an entirely new dimension—a hyper-realistic game realm directly connected to your Gamer System. You can choose the layout of this realm. It can be modeled after the world of an existing game, such as Dark Souls, or it can be an entirely unique creation shaped by your imagination. Within this realm, you’ll encounter NPCs, monsters, and an array of game mechanics, such as respawn, quick time events and more.  
The realm also offers opportunities for your Class Change. For example, you can locate specialised trainers who align with your chosen class. These mentors can accelerate your development, enabling you to level up rapidly and even granting access to rare or hidden class-specific abilities. Exploration and interaction play a key role, as building relationships with NPCs can lead to benefits, ranging from hidden items, quests or even more.  
Progress made within this realm directly affects your real-world self. Skills, experience, and abilities gained transfer seamlessly between both realities. Additionally, relationships formed with NPCs may reach a level where they can be brought into the real world.  
Time in the Game World is faster that the real world, with 3 hours in the game world being 1 hour in the real world. If you took _Accelerated Training_ upgrade then the time in the Game World can be accelerated further.
*Hacker’s Interface*
Required:Debugger Console

The Debugger Console grants you direct access to the underpinnings of the game world, enabling you to alter game mechanics and assets in real-time. With the Debugger Console, you are no longer just a player—you become a system manipulator. Through this console, you can interact with and edit the game’s source code, game logic, NPC behaviors, and world assets.  
The modifications you make using the Debugger Console are live, meaning the world reacts immediately to changes, but be careful—any errors or bugs in your code can cause system glitches or even destabilize the game world temporarily. Fortunately, a built-in version control system helps mitigate this risk. You can save versions of your work and revert to a previous state if necessary.  
While your ability to modify the system is powerful, the extent of what you can do depends on your strength


**Dynamist Jr.**
Cost: 20 SP

This power integrates with your other abilities and improves them over time. It will mutate in two ways: _horizontally_, by adding new related abilities, and _vertically_, by increasing the strength of specific aspects. Powers with a lower initial SP cost have a faster growth until they catch up to your other powers.  
While you can direct the general shape of those changes, your power will also respond and adapt to any challenge you face. When your powers are impotent, immediately useful mutations will be prioritized over long term utility. When you have time to let them grow, new optimizations and sub-powers based on predicted challenges and past difficulties, will be added. Any useless or redundant part will be shed or fused into existing abilities. With time, your weaknesses will be reduced and your options broadened.  
It is recommended you give your power time to perform routine maintenance and optimizations between heavy engagements to avoid a buildup of mutation debt. If this debt becomes too high, the quality and reliability of mutation decreases due to the stress placed on your power.  
This power works at a slower rate than _Dynamist_.

UPGRADES

**Skill Tree Jr.**
Cost: 5 SP
Required:Dynamist Jr.

Instead of automatically mutating, Dynamist Jr. will build an ever-growing upgrade tree for your powers.  
Each power has its own upgrade tree, how it works depends on the power itself but will usually follow either a fully diverging tree or a simple web of interconnected nodes.  
The number of nodes you can select depends on the form of the skill tree. For webs, the number of choices is proportional to the size  
Choices are not permanent, you can change your selection whenever you want. It takes around 5 minutes of meditation for the power to reconfigure itself, during this it cannot be used actively. Interrupting the meditation will result in a failed reconfiguration and other consequences.

**Growth Boost (Dynamist Jr.)**
1
Cost: 7 SP
Required:Dynamist Jr.

With each purchase of this upgrade, Dynamist Jr.'s rate of growth both vertically and horizontally is doubled: Power mutations that would normally take four days to manifest would now take two days, then one, then twelve hours, and so on. This upgrade also divides the time needed for Skill Tree Jr. to reconfigure itself by 1.5 with each purchase.

**Fine-Tuned Growth**
Cost: 5 SP
Required:Dynamist Jr.
You can now much more accurately influence the direction that your powers’ growth takes, allowing you to guide your mutations through specific and niche pathways rather than general themes and shapes - though, the prioritization of more imminently-useful adaptations when you are challenged or in need still remain.  
As a secondary bonus, you can now “plan” your powers’ growth and set them on a sort of autopilot, allowing them to continue on a specific, predetermined course you've visualized without continued influence, assuming no such moments of immediate need arise.

*Precision Power Engineering*
Required:Engine of Escalation

With the influence of Engine of Escalation, the rate at which you can develop desired mutations has skyrocketed. While significant deviations still take a long time to achieve, small improvements in line with how the power already functions can be manifested in mere minutes.  
This also has nullified any need for maintenance, as any manifestation of mutations will already be precisely engineered to integrate with your existing powers.  
Lastly, you can now exclude some powers from developing chaotic mutations at all if you do not wish so, with them only growing in strength, not at all, or only manifesting precisely the mutations you desire.

**Lesser Dynamist**
Cost: 40 SP
Required:Dynamist Jr.

Your mutation engine gains a deeper core of intelligence and autonomy. It is now capable of a more concentrated evolution, applying its strength with far greater focus.  
You gain three Major Powers that each cost up to 30 SP and five Minor Powers that each cost up to 15 SP. You can choose powers from the Shard list only if you have Essence of Shard. These powers are integrated directly into the core of your mutation engine and serve as the foundation of its focused evolution.  
Dynamist Jr. evolves these core powers at close to twice its normal speed and strength, enhancing them both horizontally with new sub-abilities and vertically by reinforcing key traits. However, all other non-core powers will still mutate at the the normal rate of Dynamist Jr.  
Once selected, these core powers are fixed. They cannot be swapped, replaced, or reassigned by any abilities tied to Dynamist jr. Your mutation engine treats them as permanent fixtures and uses them as its preferred ground for experimentation and refinement.
*Unified Evolution*
Required:Dynamist

Your mutation engine seamlessly integrates its two branches of evolution. All powers selected through Dynamist are now treated as core powers for the purposes of Lesser Dynamist. They receive the full benefit of accelerated growth—both in speed and strength—and are prioritized by the engine for mutations, optimizations, and sub-power development.
*Retasked Focused*
Required: Fine-Tuned Growth, Skill Tree Jr., or Upgrade Tree (Dynamist)

Your mutation engine now has dynamic control over its evolutionary priorities. You can now manually retask the enhanced growth effect of Dynamist Jr. (and Dynamist, if applicable) onto any powers of your choosing.
*Dynamist Released*
Required:Dynamist Unbound

All of your powers, regardless of core status, now benefit from the enhanced speed and strength of core power growth. Horizontal mutations, vertical reinforcements, and synergistic refinements occur across your entire build without distinction.  
With no need for selective focus, the engine operates at peak efficiency at all time for all powers allowing your entire power suite to evolve in tandem.




**Idle Trainer**
Cost: 10 SP
Welcome to the realm of Idle Training, where you can gain the results of training while being a couch potato. With this extraordinary power, you can create a perfect virtual simulation of yourself training in your mind. Within this simulation, your virtual counterpart possesses the ability to train and learn any skill or discipline that you are capable of. By simply selecting the desired focus for training, the simulation engages in rigorous practice without rest, while the time within the simulated realm moves three times faster. Once you drop the simulation, you absorb all the benefits gained as if you had done the arduous process yourself, whether it's muscle, skills, expertise, and everything else, as if you had personally undergone the training.
*Percolate*
Required:108 Skills
Armed with a copy ability that defies all logic, even a simulation of yourself isn't completely safe from imitation. While the simulation is running, you constantly gain 1/108th of the benefits that the virtual you gets from the training. This does not reduce the benefits you gain from dropping the simulation.
*Idle Grinding*
Required: Gamer System, (Trump) Gamer System
Now addition to training a specific skill, power, attribute etc., Your virtual counterpart now has the ability to passively farm EXP in the idle trainer simulated realm.  
You can choose to either manually spend the accumulated EXP yourself or have it automatically spend the EXP based on parameters you choose
*World Simulation*
Required:Survivor Simulation (10 SP)
As an alternative to the white void, you may expend your daily use of Survivor Simulation to project your simulated self into a perfect, dynamic copy of the real world, starting from the present moment. This simulation runs three times faster than reality, allowing you to observe the immediate future unfold from your double's perspective and guide its actions in real-time. When the simulation ends, you absorb its complete memories and trained skills, and are granted a a single choice of five random rewards your simulated self earned, just as if you had completed a Survivor Simulation.  
Naturally, you cannot use Idle Trainer nor Survivor Simulation inside the World Simulation.

UPGRADES
**Synchronize**
Cost: 5 SP
Required:Idle Trainer

You no longer need to drop the simulation to gain the benefit of the simulation training. The benefit you receive from the simulation is provided to you in real time.

**Additional Trainer**
Cost: 10 SP
Required:Idle Trainer

Instead of just being able to create 1 simulation you can now create up to five in total. Each simulation can be directed to train and study different things or have an additive effect when directed to train in one specific thing. For example, if you have 2 simulations dedicated to sword training then you would reap double the benefit.  
As you continue to use this power you will gradually gain the ability to create additional simulations over time

**Accelerated Training**
1
Cost: 10 SP
Required:Idle Trainer

The Flow of time in the simulated realm is increased. Each purchase of this upgrade increases the flow speed by five times over, starting at 3x to 15x, then 75x, then 375x, and then finally 1875x.


**The Chad Grindset Enjoyer**
Cost: 5 SP

You possess Joy of the Grind, an intuitive power that grants you a sixth sense to always know the best way to improve. Effortlessly, you discern the optimal strategies, skills, and actions required for self-enhancement and conquering challenges. Embracing the joy of continuous progress, you find fulfillment in the journey of growth and unyielding determination to become your very best.

**Hunter of [Insert Target Here]**
Cost: 10 SP
You've become the ultimate Hunter, those who seek to pursue and eliminate specific foes with unwavering determination. By designating a target, the user gains an extraordinary boost in all aspects, as well as abilities tailored specifically to counter and hunt down their chosen adversary.

Upon selecting their target, the wielder will feel a shift in their physical and mental attributes. Their strength, speed, agility, and intellect all receive a boost, empowering them to hunt their formidable foe. The user's instincts also sharpen to unparalleled levels, enabling them to perceive weaknesses and anticipate the enemy's moves with uncanny precision.

However, this power requires the user to be near the target to stay active, within a range of 10 kilometers. The potency of the boost depends on the precision and strength of the designated target. Against broad categories like demons or vampires, the enhancement may be moderate, providing a 20-30% increase in abilities and a minor ability to counter the creature. Such as against demons, the user may gain the ability to imbue their touch with holy energy.

But if the user designates a single, exceptionally powerful individual as their target, their newfound abilities and strength skyrocket. Their power can easily double or triple. Moreover, a suite of specialized abilities to pierce through defenses and exploit vulnerabilities is unlocked. This might encompass the ability to discern and bypass magical barriers, exploit elemental weaknesses, or even adapt in real-time to counter the target's strategies.

Furthermore, this power grants the user a sixth sense, allowing them to always know the location of their designated target within a range of over 100 kilometers. This unparalleled awareness ensures they can constantly track down and confront their adversary, never losing sight of their pursuit.

**Limit Breaker**
Cost: 15 SP

Limit breaks are the designation of techniques and abilities that go beyond the current limits of their user's capability. They are miraculous trump cards that only arise in moments of desperation, greatly swinging the tide of battle for the one able to pull them off. Now you too can use limit breaks.  
You now have an internal pool of energy that slowly builds over time as you begin and continue to battle, which can be visualized as 3 gauges. The more intense the battle, the faster the bar fills up. When one of the bars fills up completely, you can amplify a single attack or ability by 5 times its original potency. The amplifications stack upon one another, so using 2 bars would boost the potency to 25 times, and using all 3 bars would boost the ability to 125 times its original potency.  
  
This boost in potency doesn’t only give a raw boost in power but also an additional modifier that the attack or ability did not have before such as a healing spell gaining the ability to resurrect the dead, a defensive ability granting invulnerability to all damage for a time or an attack gaining the capability to ignore all defense and becoming sure hit. The more gauges are used the more additional modifiers will be granted to the abilities.  
The bar can only be charged up when engaging in combat but will not dissipate when the battle is over. This means you can save limited gauge energy for future encounters. While you start with 3 bars your internal pool of energy can grow over time with the use of limit breaks so you can gain additional bars as you keep using them.

**Breaker of Chains**
Cost: 25 SP

You have shattered the shackles of impossibility and improbability, emerging as a force capable of achieving the extraordinary and defying the odds. What others deem impossible and unimaginable, you perceive as mere challenges to conquer. Destiny and fate hold no sway over you, for you are immune to their confines. Neither seals nor chains can ever confine you again. You shall never be ensnared or trapped against your will, effortlessly breaking free from any hindrance that obstructs your path. Your potential for growth knows no bounds, and any limitations imposed upon your abilities can be shattered through perseverance and the passage of time.

UPGRADE
**Broken Limiter**
Cost: 10 SP
Required:The Chad Grindset Enjoyer
Required:Breaker of Chains

The road to even greater progress usually gets steeper as you ascend and your strength and powers reach previously unheard-of levels. Not for you, though. You don't follow the rules about bottlenecks, soft caps, or decreasing returns. Rather, your advancement travels along a distinct path, unrestricted by traditional boundaries. Whenever you train, you experience a situation where every step you take forward causes your progress to accelerate exponentially. Essentially, the more you advance in power, the faster you will advance, experiencing an incredible adventure filled with limitless possibility and unwavering growth.

**Promethean Ichor**
Cost: 10 SP

Your heart has crystallized itself, becoming indestructible and eternal. No longer is it mere blood being pumped throughout your body. Through your veins runs your life force condensed into an impossible form, the Prima Materia, an iridescent golden ichor. You have surpassed the realm of men, breaching into a new level of existence.   
Due to your heart's transformation, your ichor constantly seeps into your mind and body, enhancing it, improving all aspects of yourself, and granting you endless mental and physical stamina, allowing you to function at your best indefinitely. You are able to direct your life force through your heart, allowing you to improve yourself at the cellular level. Nothing is impossible with enough experience and dedicated life force. Your mutations will be manageable and never will negatively impact each other.  
Your human imperfections will be burnt away, allowing you to progress beyond human limits with enough dedication to your actions. Igniting your heart's power fills you with divine inspiration as you burn away your imperfections, enabling you to improve through means of regression to perfection. Finding balance will come with time, knowing when it is best to start with a fresh slate and proper comprehension. Every time you regress you set yourself up for a better future learning faster depending on how many times you've burnt out the impurities of your actions.  
Your life force lets you heal from scrapes and wounds instantly, while regrowing fingers in minutes, and arms and legs in hours. You will never have to worry about old age, for you have undergone an ascension, putting you among the immortal ones for as long as your heart beats true. Your healing is perfect, always restoring you to your best.  
Whenever you do not actively wish to keep your ichor outside your body, the Prima Materia will shift into liquid lead, unconnected to your existence.

**Forged In The Trials of Combat**
Cost: 10 SP

Your power now grows rapidly whenever you engage in combat. The harder you push your limits, the faster your fighting capabilities develop in both potency and mastery.  
In battle, connections form in your mind more quickly. Techniques you have just learned, even unfamiliar ones, swiftly become second nature. As you seek ways to counter your opponent, new uses for your existing power will emerge, with inspiration and epiphanies rushing into your mind.  
With this power, a friendly sparring session can be more effective than a week of regular training. A life-or-death struggle, where death is almost certain, would enhance both the potency and mastery of your power, as well as your battle IQ, equivalent to a year of intense training.

UPGRADE
**Perfected In The Fires of War**
Cost: 15 SP
Required:Forged In The Trials of Combat

You embody the phrase "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger." Your power grows exponentially with each combat encounter.  
  
You possess a godly battle IQ, allowing you to instantly analyze the entire battlefield, identifying points of interest, useful items, and the strengths and weaknesses of your opponent. This advanced analytical ability enables you to devise effective tactics and strategies, no matter how unconventional they may be.  
The trials of battle also enhance your own powers and skills. With each use, your abilities develop beyond their original conception. You can adapt or create new techniques on the fly, making them as familiar to you as if you had practiced them your entire life. Additionally, the same technique will rarely work against you twice.  
Given the means, you can also copy your opponent's powers or techniques by creating your own version that is functionally identical.  
Even outside of combat, your creativity regarding all things related to battle is massively increased, allowing you to find new uses for your powers and combine them into lethal mixtures.  
Sparring is now more effective for you than months of training, and life-or-death struggles, where one wrong move could lead to death, enhance your power equivalent to years or even decades of training depending on how long the battle lasted.


**Monster of Desire**
Cost: 10 SP

You become a monstrous being truly driven by its own desires. When you gain this power, you must pick an obsession to be your primary desire (or simply let your naturally strongest desire take over) and revel in it, which will slowly make you better and stronger, improving your core being and all of your powers.  
Simple indulgence like lazing around like a sloth or satisfying your vanity by taking selfies will benefit you, but at a quite slow rate. But when you become truly depraved, you and your powers will rapidly evolve as you rob a bank out of greed, slaughter a group of criminals for justice, kill the entire family of your enemy out of jealousy, and revel in the high of becoming greater as you conquer everything you dreamt of.  
Not all desires are inherently evil; after all, one can become a monster of justice and benevolence just as easily as any other "sin”.  
  
The more absurd your actions and the more you ride the high of your own excitement, the more your powers evolve and restrictions lessen. When you truly outdone yourself riding the manic ecstasy of your self-indulgence, you can even reach enlightenment, unlocking transformations massively amplifying and evolving your entire power kit, even developing new secondary powers.  
  
Meanwhile, you will always beholden to your primary desire, and as you discover more of it, you can branch out to any connected vices. After all, you can satisfy your pride by being a perfect paragon of justice while also being a proud owner of the finest collection of wines. And truly, is there anything humanity can’t lust for?  
But this comes with the drawback that your satisfaction is always temporary. You will always dream of greater ecstasy, chasing a new experience like a deep abyss of sweet temptation, which drives you to dive deeper and deeper, making your potential to evolve and grow more powerful truly endless. Your ability to indulge is limitless, as whatever your primary desire is, it can always become better, more and _more_ and _**more**_ and _**MORE**_…

*Unleashed Monstrosity*
Required:Innocent Monster (Type-Moon)

_The Ugliest Flower_  
You revel in your monstrous reputation, which no longer affects you in your everyday life as you are in peace with your own desires and actions, allowing you to keep up your normal appearance. But your awful power is not lost. When you embrace your own reputation or are in great distress, it will make you undergo a new transformation, showing the world what they believe you to be and removing all mental inhibitions that would stop you from fulfilling your desires, turning you into a true monster. This transformation is only undone if you are truly defeated or if the goal that made you transform is achieved.

*Self-Indulgence of Desire*
Required:Cursed Energy Manipulation (Jujutsu Kaisen)

As a sorcerer your mindset can no longer hold you back, just like how Satoru Gojo has an absolute belief in his own invincibility you have the same confidence in your own boundless desires. This will allow you to advance and experience rapid breakthrough in all jujutsu techniques you have, your growth can never be stunted as you will always desire to be greater than before.

*Prime Desire*
Required:Prime Soul (ULTRAKILL)

Your willpower joined your desire in an unholy coalescence, creating a corrupted but much more powerful driving force. Now, when you die, you will experience everything you’ve done to indulge in your primary desire in a single moment, fueling and evolving your manifested soul form, making it more powerful depending on the amount of indulgence you experienced during your lifetime. Because of this fusion, you can fuel your willpower by indulging in your primary desire, so as long as you stay true to yourself, your will is unbreakable!

*Creature of Sin*
Required:Half-Devil (High School DxD)

Your primary sin as a devil will synergize with your primary desire, which allows you to grow your demonic energy quality and quantity through indulgence. Your power of imagination-based spells will also greatly increase in both efficiency and potency if it serves your desire. Through multiple transformations, you might even achieve a final form comparable to Sirzechs Lucifer’s true form through sheer monstrous desire, even without any bloodline power to assist you.

*Awakened Monster*
Required:Awakened Origin (Type-Moon)

If you choose to have the same origin and desire, then you are no longer limited to the improvement and evolution of your existing powers; now, out of sheer desire, you can develop new powers. Gain enhanced senses to stalk your prey in your ravenous gluttony, obtain super strength to satisfy your pride, or possess the power to imprison a creature in a seal, enacting your personal justice. Now there is nothing you cannot do; the question is, is your desire great enough for it?

*Secondary Obsession Drive*
Required:Negative Emotion Drive (Magical Girl Tyrant Sylph)

Now you are not only fuelled by negative emotions, but you can also create and store energy from your own primary desires. This secondary stockpile can only be unleashed when you are already under the effect of the Negative Emotion Drive, mixing your desire with the already present negativity, creating an even more potent driving force and also driving you into a frenzy of your darkest desires.

*Monster of the Grind*
Required:The Chad Grindset Enjoyer

Your need for indulgence has been replaced with the Joy of the Grind, creating a powerful feedback loop of indulgence. The more you indulge, the more you improve, the more you improve, the more you indulge. This massively increases the benefits gained from pursuing your desires, allowing any indulgence, no matter how small, to provide a feeling of improvement.  
No longer do you chase desire with withdrawal but with the thrill of being one step closer to becoming your very best.

**The Honored One**
Cost: 20 SP

From the moment you entered the world, the definition of power was forever redefined.  
Your rise to be the strongest is almost inevitable, with the only thing capable of stopping you is if you slack off on your training, or an early demise. This power is accomplished through incredibly fast and virtually unstoppable growth, for you are him. You are the exception, the coincidence, the thing that shouldn’t happen yet it does. Yet, one day, your ascent will slow as you encounter three profound hurdles on your path to being the strongest. Each hurdle will challenge you more than you would expect, but overcoming one will grant you a surge in power and accelerate your growth even further, with each hurdle being more potent then the last.  
  
First hurdle: The Depth of Resolve  
What will you sacrifice for power? How much are you willing to sacrifice to be the strongest? Perhaps family, or a bit of your sanity? Sometimes the desire of power demands an obscene amount of sacrifice. Will you meet its demands and make the sacrifices that must be made, or will you demand freedom of choice?  
  
Second hurdle: The Acceptance of Self  
Every individual is unique, and uniqueness brings flaws. You must embody your true self to the highest degree, otherwise what is the point in existing? If you are a hypocrite, you must accept your hypocrisy and revel in it. If you are a warrior, then you must bathe in blood and stand above the corpses of your enemies. You must accept every single aspect of yourself, or change your true self until you embody the ideals you desire.  
  
Third hurdle: The Pinnacle of Strength  
“Throughout Heaven and Earth, I alone am the honored one.”  
You do not chase for power, power chases you. Your strength is true, not because it towers above others, but because it stands unshaken by doubt. Arrogance isn’t what you possess—it's in knowing who you are, even when the world trembles in rejection. Yet now comes the ultimate question: What does it mean to be the strongest? In isolation, when there is no audience to witness, no foe to vanquish, and no accolades to earn, what does it mean to be the strongest?

*Royalty*
Required:The Sanctioned Action (Kill Six Billion Demons)

“There is only one step on the path to royalty. It is the idiot’s step, and it stretches to the horizon.” -Ya’at Death Poem  
You have achieved what could be considered both the hardest and easiest feat possible: understanding the true name of God and reach a state of being, attained by few throughout the history of the Wheel—true Royalty.  
You have mastered yourself entirely, attaining self-mastery, self-acceptance, and self-actualization to become the king of your own being. This level of self-realization grants you absolute freedom from all outside influence, even from the bounds of reality itself.  
You have forged an invincible sense of self and an unbreakable will, impervious to any force. Not even the strongest mental assaults, the most seductive illusions, the pain of unbearable torture, unfathomable eldritch truths, or cosmic shattering revelations can leave a trace on the tower that is your mind.  
The three hurdles designed to slow your progress have effectively ceased to exist, as your current state has far surpassed the challenges they present. This fuels your unstoppable growth even further accelerating your already rapid advancement to an exponential degree, transforming you into a continuous cutting motion that moves ever forward to your intended destination.

**Ringbearer**
Cost: 20 SP

Hail, Ringmaker/Ringbearer. Hail to that who hold the words.  
As ringmaker, you have a singular ability: you can summon a single ring each month. Multiple of these rings can be summoned at once should multiple months have passed. Similarly, you can recall a ring into yourself to be reproduced, no matter how far from you it may be or who is wearing it.  
The rings themselves are more complex. Their primary purpose is to be gifted to others; to this end, they vary in form, shifting in size and shape to fit the taste of whoever is their ringbearer.  
The Rings’ most visible ability, however, is enhancement. While a ringbearer wears it, you can enhance any abilities they may have as if 20SP were given to them. This includes giving them new attributes or powers as long as you yourself already possess them.  
  
The flow of this energy is not one-way, however. The ring’s main function is to supplement yourself with others, allowing you to duplicate their own attributes and abilities as long as they wear your gift. For example, a Pyromancer wearing your gift to unleash torrents of hellfire would, in turn, grant you their prior level of proficiency in the magic before the ring’s enhancement.  
  
Finally, the ring’s most insidious facet. The more a Ringbearer wears a ring, the more their will begins to defer to your own. When coupled with the implicit loyalty required to receive their new power, very few will be willing to openly defy their Ringmaker.  
You can wear your own rings, but they will be reduced to half of their usual potency.

*Shackle*
Required:A Warrior's Bond

Thanks to your understanding of the Warrior’s Bond, you’re able to transform individuals into Rings instead of using your own well of energy. While transformed, they are almost identical to other Rings, but both lightly affect the personality of the wearer, and require a clash of wills with their wielder, as they usually would if transformed unwillingly.

*Lesser Amendments*
Required:Ten Commandments

Your spheres and their workings have impacted your ring making. Your Rings can now act as ‘lesser’ spheres of our own, being of roughly half the potency of your ‘real’ spheres.  
The rings cannot be imbued and must be worn, but otherwise act as conduits of Destruction, Alteration, and Creation. They are also subject to your Thinker abilities as a result.

*Adornment*
Required:Alloy Fusion
You can use your Alloy pool to fuse rings, combining their potency in all factors.

*Long Distance Engineering*
Required: Engineer, Builder, (Trump/Tinker) Shards, (Trump) Shard Supply Store, or Pramant

Your rings now function as tinkering nodes for your other powers, allowing you to modify and enhance granted abilities as if they were an extension of your own power. Each ring, when given to others, act as 20SP nodes that you can reconfigure at any time or distance, without the wearer’s awareness or consent.  
As a result, you are not restricted to giving or enhancing powers you already possess or those thematically linked to the wearer. A ring can now give any ability you can create, creating a possibility for diverse and adaptable power set for any user.  
Additionally, you can remotely reconfigure, weaken, or fully disable a ring’s enhancements at will. The ring’s influence over its wearer can also be adjusted at any time, subtly scaling their deference to your will as needed.  
If worn by you instead of another, the ring still provides free customizable 10SP of enhancements to your own abilities that can be changed at a moments notice.

**Evolution**
Cost: 10 SP

Every action performed by you is meticulously recorded, and each action generates a specific amount of energy based on its nature, significance, and impact. This energy accumulates over time, steadily building within you. Once the accumulated energy reaches a critical threshold, you will undergoes an evolution.  
The nature of this evolution is influenced by three core factors: your inherent powers, your racial or biological traits, and the precise combination of actions recorded before the evolution. The powers and traits of the wielder act as a foundation, setting the boundaries and potential paths for the transformation. Meanwhile, the recorded actions shape the specific direction of the evolution, ensuring that the transformation reflects your experiences, choices, and growth.  
Each evolution represents a leap in your capabilities, reshaping your physical form, mental acuity, or abilities in ways that align with their developmental journey. They boost your existing powers, enhancing their strength and effectiveness, while also unlocking new variant powers or subpowers. These variants can complement your core abilities or introduce entirely new ways to use your skills, expanding your versatility and adapting to your needs. In most cases, your evolution also refines your physical form or mental capabilities, aligning them more closely with your enhanced powers.  
The rate at which you evolve depends on the quality and significance of your actions. Challenging, impactful, or meaningful deeds generate more energy, allowing you to evolve more quickly, while mundane or repetitive actions contribute less to your growth.

*Echoes of Newmanity*
Required: Apex Specimen
Required: The Composite Human
The records that detail and lay the foundation of your Evolution have themselves evolved due to the supplementary information of the entire existence of Humanity and any other species you possess; this means that all your evolutions are supercharged, with any weaknesses that could come from them removed, as you gain access to greater power, with each evolution becoming the idealized version of itself, which then becomes the perfect foundation for your next leap.  
However, while the evolutions are empowered, you still need to work towards them and meet any special requirements, such as needing to understand several True Magics to become an Age of Will human from the Nasuverse.

*Over Evolution!!*
Required: Wait, I Got Just the Form for This!
Required: This isn't even my final form
Your ability to evolve into a greater version of yourself has merged with your ability to create new linear and branching forms, the three powers feeding into one another to make them greater.  
At the bare minimum, the increase you gain from all evolutions becomes x10, liken to you assimilating your x10 transformation into your base form, before other factors come in to push it even further.  
Your various forms gain a piece of Evolution's power, allowing the different forms to grow stronger passively through use. This is especially evident with your alternate/slide forms as they become more than specialized forms based on your current evolution, and instead become branches of your evolution tree you can draw upon, providing stronger abilities and specialities. You can stack these different forms on top of one another for more creative and strange forms.

**More for Less**
Cost: 10 SP
To get more for less. This is your philosophy and now it has become your very nature.
Whatever you lose, give away or use up, you ‘lose’ 10% less than what the original amount would be. Similarly, whatever you gain, develop or produce, you ‘gain’ 10% more than you would otherwise, so long as it makes feasible sense.
Reality itself adjusts to accommodate these bonuses. For example, if physically fighting an enemy, you would expend 10% less energy and effort while delivering 10% more force and damage with every strike. When shopping, you can buy at a 10% discount and get 10% more of whatever you purchase, with the same effect applied when selling.
This power applies on a conceptual level to nearly everything concerning yourself, as long as it is a ‘loss’ or ‘gain’. This power would not affect your blood pumping around your body, for instance, but it would apply if you were bleeding out. Whether it concerns your body, mind, powers, social relationships, the technology you operate, your assets or anything else, you will always retain and acquire more than expected.
These discounts and surcharges are always beneficial and you can freely control when this power is active. You can also choose whether the power's effects are noticeable, preventing others from perceiving them if you prefer. This power does not affect itself, nor does it repeatedly affect growth or limit-breaking abilities; applying only once in such cases.

**Researcher's Madness**
Cost: 5 SP

You can choose any power in the world, and you chose to _study_? Well, I’ll be damned.  
You can study any power you have and can naturally learn, though this doesn’t mean you get information handed to you for free. Through study, experimentation, and practice, you increase the potency and variability of your abilities. Time is on your side—your powers can always be improved. Even if you lack powers entirely, you are able to study mundane principles, pushing them to new heights. Physics, engineering, chemistry, or even simple crafts become your playground, letting you pioneer advancements that no one else can imagine.  
What sets you apart is that you can’t suffer from burnout. In fact, it’s the opposite—studying energises you. The deeper you dive into understanding your abilities, the more focused and alive you feel.  
Experimentation becomes your playground. Each failure is a chance to refine, and every small success unlocks new layers of potential. Failure is never the end for you; it’s a stepping stone. Every time you fail, it’s as if the pieces of the puzzle rearrange themselves, revealing a new insight. Each failure sparks a revelation, an exponential boost to your understanding. Instead of frustration, failure feels like uncovering the next secret layer of your abilities.  
As you study, you don’t just become stronger—you become adaptable. You learn to layer your powers, combining them in ways that multiply their effectiveness. You create variants, tweaking the nature of your abilities like a craftsman refining their tools. Over time, you gain a perfect understanding of your powers’ essence, breaking them down to their core. This lets you reassemble them with precision, changing how they work, expanding their use, and sometimes creating something entirely new. This isn’t limited to your powers but to anything you can study, from technology you make to mundane subjects.

*Archive of Research*
Required:Archive

Your archive’s internal world has become a personalised realm shaped by your creativity and focus. Whether it takes the form of a sprawling library, a high-tech laboratory, or a mystical forge, it adapts to your needs, offering the perfect environment to explore your powers, theories, and inventions.  
Within this internal world, you can create fully interactive simulations, testing abilities, designs, or ideas without risk to the outside world. You also possess the ability to pause moments in your experiments, entering a slowed-down mental state where every detail can be analysed with perfect clarity. Failures and successes alike resonate through the archive, sparking moments of revelation and evolving the space itself. Each experiment you conduct feeds the archive, unlocking new tools, environments, and insights tailored to your unique journey.  
In this internal world you can manifest multiple versions of yourself within it to debate, brainstorm, and collaborate on complex problems. They can offer real-time insights, alternative strategies, and even unexpected combinations of your abilities. Each duplicate works independently, allowing for unparalleled multitasking, but the mental burden is shared equally among them. Two of you mean twice the mental strain and overdoing it with too many duplicates can lead to headaches, fatigue, or other symptoms. After all, not suffering from burnout is different from literally splitting your mind.

*The Scholar of the Grind*
Required: The Chad Grindset Enjoyer, or Revelation (Type-Moon)

You possess an instinctive understanding of where to direct your efforts in research and study, building a strong foundation that accelerates your progress and makes it easier to expand upon your initial discoveries. Each step strengthens your grasp of the subject, helping you identify promising paths for deeper exploration while avoiding unproductive avenues.  
This strong foundation sharpens your ability to discern which methods, topics, or strategies will yield valuable insights and which will lead to dead ends. Over time, this instinct doesn’t just help you master subjects—it allows you to innovate, create unique approaches, and achieve breakthroughs that others might overlook.

**Get Off My Lawn!**
Cost: 5 SP

The older you become, be it mentally, physically, or, with the right abilities, spiritually, the stronger you grow.  
Your physical strength increases beyond natural limits, muscles becoming denser, reflexes quicker, and endurance lasting longer. Injuries heal faster, fatigue becomes a less prominent, and your body adapts to new challenges with greater efficiency.  
Your mind follows the same path, expanding in intelligence, clarity, and resilience. Memory becomes clearer, thoughts process at greater speed, and your understanding of the world deepens with each experience. Emotional control strengthens, wisdom accumulates, and your strategic thinking sharpens until you can predict outcomes with near-perfect accuracy.  
Your powers and abilities also grow alongside you. With time, they refine, strengthen, and become more efficient, reaching levels that were once impossible. Control becomes effortless, limitations fade, and what once required focus or effort eventually becomes second nature.  
If you possess spiritual or supernatural abilities, they too evolve alongside you, growing in power and mastery. Every year, at minimum, you will have grown by 10% with this growth being additive rather than compounding. If the age between your mind, body or soul is different, this will use the oldest one.  
On its own, it gives a form of longevity, but not immortality as the issues of age will eventually catch up.

**Dragon’s Hoard**
Cost: 10 SP
The manifestation of greed and desire.
You possess an ability conceived as one of the potential explanations for why dragons hoard; that they draw power from their hoard, and now so do you as well.
Every single object you possess ownership of, regardless of how it was acquired, provides a boost in power. The boost your hoard gives you is more than a simple increase in power, it bolsters and enhances all factors of your very existence, loosening restrictions and potentially even evolving you into a higher life form with new abilities once your hoard grows big enough.

The boost gained from an object scales with its value, both intrinsic and perceived, but suffers diminishing returns as you gain more of it. In an average world gold may provide some boost at first, but acquire enough eventually it’ll take literal tons to make even the smallest of gains. On the other hand, In a world where gold is scarce, non-existent, or has a higher perceived value than it will provide greater gains, although it will still be subject to diminishing returns. The only things exempt from diminishing returns are one of a kind objects such as powerful magical artifacts or mastercrafted pieces of art.
If you lose ownership of an object, i.e. it is no longer conceptually yours, then you lose the boost you gained from said object. There are certain exceptions, like if your hoard became large enough that you evolved. Losing your hoard won't make you suddenly unevolve, although you'll still lose the extra boost to your power.
*Krepel*
Required:Terrestrial Inventory
Interesting thing isn’t it, ownership?
Not only does the Inventory give you access to potentially infinite novel items, your Hoard now encompasses anything kept in its ‘pocket dimension’. But furthermore this link goes both ways, allowing you to store anything you have in your hoard in your pocket as if you’d summoned it.
Additionally, you can now get a ‘return on investment’ from your hoard, essentially being able to sacrifice parts of it to receive charge in your pool that can be spent like any other you’ve naturally developed.
That said, the value extracted from this never exceeds 5sp worth of charge at a time, and has diminishing returns the more items of similar type are used. Ie; coins, weapons, etc. Meaning you’ll have to keep a diverse (or overwhelmingly huge)hoard to maintain any steady flow out of this conversion.

**Greatest of Sins, Pride**
Cost: 10 SP
_Your are not prideful because you are strong,  
You are strong because you are prideful.  
Your claims are true. Your claims are adamant. Your might, unbound. Your will, unbreakable.  
Your ego unshatterable, for you are pride, and pride is for those at the top._  
You draw power from the sin of Pride—not the shallow arrogance of the boastful, but a deeper, honed pride rooted in your actions, your identity, and your unwavering belief in your worth. This path allows you to grow stronger not by denying your ego, but by mastering it—fueling your evolution through confidence, self-respect, and the will to rise above mediocrity.  
There are two forms of pride that shape your power.  
The first is hollow pride: the pride of appearances, of empty boasts and fleeting praise. In moments of vanity, when you are blinded by unearned glory or a need to be seen as superior, your power will spike dramatically. This kind of pride grants you sudden, potent surges—a blow that strikes harder than it should, an overwhelming presence that demands attention. But it is as unstable as it is intoxicating. When that illusion falters—when doubt, humiliation, or self-loathing sets in—the power vanishes as fast as it appears. It is a brilliant flare in the dark, but it leaves you emptier than before.  
The second is rightful pride: earned, honest, and rooted in both action and self-awareness. This is pride in what you’ve done—from facing trials, overcoming adversity, and staying true to your principles—but also in who you are. When you stand tall not because others told you to, but because you know your value, your power begins to evolve. When you take pride in your hard-earned victories, your loyalty, your growth, or even your flaws overcome, it rewards you with steady, compounding strength. The longer you walk this path with true pride, the faster you grow.  
And this applies not just to your victories, but to your very sense of self. When you take pride in your personality—your resilience, your compassion, your discipline, your ambition—your power deepens. You become difficult to sway, harder to break, and far more than the sum of your skills. This pride is not arrogance—it is a kind of armor, forged from truth, self-knowledge, and persistence.  
A mage who embraces the years spent mastering their craft, who knows their mind is sharp and their vision clear, will find their spells not just stronger, but more refined, faster, and harder to counter. A warrior who fights not for glory but because they know their strength protects others will grow with every battle, each strike carrying the weight of conviction. The more pride you take in your every step, the more every step transforms you.  
In time, the pride you carry will not merely empower you—it will define you.

**Against the Tides**
Cost: 10 SP

You and your powers are empowered in direct proportion to the adversity you face. The more severe your situation—the greater the number of enemies, the stronger they are, the more injured you or your allies become, the fewer allies remain, and the closer you are to failing your objective—the more your power increases. This scaling is responsive to the real-time conditions of the battle or scenario, adapting to both physical and strategic pressures.  
If you succeed in completing your objective while under this heightened stress—regardless of whether success means defeating your enemies, surviving a set period, rescuing a target, or any other defined victory condition—you retain a portion of the enhanced power permanently.  
If you exceed the required conditions—for instance, defeating or disabling your enemies when you only needed to delay them, or completing your mission with zero casualties when only one life needed saving—the retained boost increases exponentially. A flawless or overwhelming success can result in the full temporary power becoming a permanent enhancement to your base state.

**Let’s Go Gambling**
Cost: 3 SP
Every 24 hours, you receive one charge which can be spent to permanently improve another power you have by 1% of its base in a single attribute. The improvement can randomly target any measurable aspect of the ability, including (but not limited to): raw output, effective range/area, duration, cooldown, frequency, and efficiency. Additionally, any charge has a 10% chance to double the effectiveness of the increase.

Should you achieve the furthest possible increase in a given stat, the charge will automatically reroll. The stats with maximums are efficiency and cooldown, which cap at 50% improvement



# Beauty & Charisma Powers

 
## Esoteric & Abstract

**Crown of Royalty**
Cost: 15 SP

A Crown hovers above you—unseen by most, but felt by all.  
  
It marks you as Royalty, present since birth, growing heavier with time, and with it, so do you. Your beauty is enchanting, your eyes shine brighter, your words carry further, your steps lead truer.  
  
Your very being becomes greater, **_more_** than all else. There is no summit to this ascent; to limit you would be to betray the order of all things.  
  
Strength, endurance, longevity, spirit and more stretch beyond mortal bounds. You move with greater poise, perceive with greater clarity, and strike with deeper weight—physically, mentally, spiritually, ontologically, even metaphysically.  
  
Obstacles—material, magical, ideological, or otherwise—yield where they would resist others. Laws of nature and society bend subtly or part entirely. Reality inclines in your favor: your voice, your will, your motion, all settle outcomes with disproportionate finality. What you wield—tool, word, or force—moves as though fate steadies your hand and inevitability presses down onto existence.  
Your abilities grow with unnatural pace, resist outside influence, remove limits and surge with self-actualizing momentum. They refine themselves in silent recognition of your station, ever pressing toward mastery and beyond.  
  
Should another outstrip your talents in anything, such as swordplay, sorcery, chess or esoteric things, your own talent rises to meet and surpass theirs—until your precedence is restored.  
  
These talents must be something your species can be born with or aquire. They must also exist in the World you are in. If you want talents beyond your species or World, they must be aquired another way first.  
  
In all things tied to rule and refinement—command, diplomacy, art, bearing—you move with a native ease, as if born to embody these things.

## Foundation

**The Great Man Theory**
Cost: 15 SP

You are not one to rely on ancestral powers or borrowed abilities. Instead, you possess an innate and extraordinary power that sets you apart as a natural genius and modern-day Great Person. This power is uniquely yours, always active and under your complete control. It is a reflection of your own capabilities and achievements, unrestricted by any external influences or compulsions.  
  
As you accomplish great feats, your accomplishments themselves transform into incredible abilities. The magnitude of your achievements determines the power you gain. Whether it be changing the world through revolutionary discoveries or leaving a lasting impact on society, the greater your accomplishments, the more immense your bestowed abilities become. Strangling a hundred individuals may grant you supernaturally strong arms, while reshaping the world with the popularization of easy electricity use could empower you to unleash lightning that can glass an entire continent.  
  
In addition to your unparalleled intellectual prowess, your mastery of martial arts transcends the limits of what is considered possible, allowing you to defeat highly trained operatives effortlessly, regardless of their supernatural abilities. Your strikes bypass esoteric defenses and supernatural shields, leaving your opponents unable to negate the impact of your devastating martial moves.  
  
Moreover, your innate charisma and intuition enable you to assemble a formidable team. You possess an extraordinary talent for identifying individuals who share similar traits, powers, skillsets, or even partner preferences. Even among the rarest occurrences, you can swiftly locate those who possess parallel abilities and effortlessly persuade them to join your cause, provided they are not already affiliated with a rival group. The world bends to your will as you effortlessly gather a group of like-minded individuals with whom you can achieve greatness.

# Tinker/Tech/Artifice/Item Powers

## Foundation

**Terrestrial Inventory**
Cost: 20 SP

You gain access to the _Terrestrial Inventory_. This power allows you to summon almost anything you can imagine and store it in a dimensional pocket—be it mundane, supernatural, all the way to the metaphysical, you can summon any item in the known omniverse, providing you have the energy.  
  
To summon an item, you have to use energy which you slowly accumulate. By default, you gain enough energy to summon an item worth 5SP per day. This energy is stored if not spent which you can use to summon objects worth more.  
  
You have a mental search that allows you to search for specific items. When looking at items from this list, you gain a description of what it is, what it can do, how powerful it is, and what restrictions it has as well as its side-effects.  
  
When not in use, you can store anything you summon in a special pocket dimension by touching it again.  
  
Note: As actual 'SP' usually scales exponentially, the amount of energy you would need to save in your pool to create something worth '20SP' wouldn’t be 4 days but closer to 14-20, with an even longer wait to something worth '30SP' and higher.
*Fictisummon*
Required:(Trump/Striker) Fictiportation
With the theoretically-unlimited-but-slow Inventory, you can now use the charge from Terrestrial Inventory to supersede the PRT Rating 10 limit from _Fictiportation_.  
Naturally, as only a certain category of items would eclipse this power, it functionally lets you ‘budget’ charges to succeed your limits.

*Dead Artificer Society*
Required:The Celestial Workshop
Thanks to the Inventory, you can breathe life into your creations permanently.  
Anything you create with the _Celestial Workshop_ can be created through the Terrestrial Inventory for half of the energy it would usually require to produce, though it is required to be fully completed within the Celestial Workshop before you get this ‘discount’.

*Inventory of Wonders*
Required:Collector of Wonders
Through the _Collector of Wonder_, any item summoned through the _Terrestrial Inventory_ will manifest within _The Celestial Workshop_, appearing as though you crafted it yourself.  
Furthermore, the Right of Ownership will extend to all items summoned through the Terrestrial Inventory. You can also teleport any item created or summoned via _The Celestial Workshop_ or _Terrestrial Inventory_ into your pocket dimension, regardless of distance.

**Tinker of Fiction**
Cost: 25 SP

You gain the ability to build technology from fictional worlds. Worlds where the technology requires a specific energy source or materials will give you knowledge on how to make that material using what you have, or produce that energy with specially designed equipment. You fully understand the mechanics behind the technology and can iterate or build upon it as you feel like.  
Technology trees are split into up to ten tiers depending on how much depth they offer. World with multiple distinct technology trees need to be purchased individually (Endless Space would have a tree for each faction for example).  
Each week (or 168 earth hours), you gain one charge which can be used to either purchase a new random technology tree at first tier or raise the tier of an existing one. You can only have on tree active at once, you can choose which tree you will have active for the next day but cannot change during the day, the change happens at midnight.

UPGRADES
**Multiple Choice (Tinker of Fiction)**
Cost: 15 SP
Required:Tinker of Fiction
You can now choose tech trees. You can still optionally select for random tech trees but if you have a specific tree in mind it won't be up to RNG.

**Multidisciplinary (Tinker of Fiction)**
Cost: 10 SP
Required:Tinker of Fiction
You're now no longer restricted to using one tech tree at a time, allowing you to mix and match tech. You can integrate the Crysis Nanosuit into your MJOLNIR power armor, mount Alpha Centauri Singularity Weapons on the Normandy, install Star Wars holoprojectors in your Pipboy, and generally ignore the boundaries between tech trees.

**Thinker of Fiction (Tinker of Fiction)**
Cost: 15 SP
Required:Tinker of Fiction
Each Node, as you purchase or upgrade a technology tree, you gain not only the technology but also the corresponding expertise tied to that tree. This expertise can range from intellectual, tactical, and strategic knowledge to cultural insights and practical skills, all integrated seamlessly into your mind and body. This power grants you a comprehensive understanding of the systems, philosophies, and techniques from the fictional universe where the technology originates, transforming you into both a creator and practitioner.  
For example, unlocking a tier in Mass Effect's Human Tech tree might grant you Cerberus spy training or Alliance military tactics. Gaining access to Warhammer 40k’s Adeptus Mechanicus tech would not only give you intricate knowledge of machine crafting but also a deep understanding of their Rites, Canticles, and Prayers, even those outside of pure technological worship. Similarly, unlocking the Endless Space Horatio faction’s tech would provide insights into cloning and eugenics-based societal planning

**The Tinker System**
Cost: 5 SP
Required: Tinker of Fiction, or Blacksmith of Potential
Required: Gamer System, or (Trump) Gamer System

The Gamer System has undergone significant evolution through its integration with Tinker of Fiction, resulting in transformative changes. A key addition is the Technology Tab, a comprehensive archive of knowledge that spans every conceivable world. This feature encompasses super-science, speculative advancements, and potential future human technologies. It goes beyond fictional universes, offering access to a near-limitless repository of innovation and possibility.  
The system operates using two types of currency: Catalog Points (CP) and Tech Tree Points (TTP). Catalog Points allow you to unlock technologies specific to individual factions, species, or civilizations. For example, you could acquire the full scope of human technology from Mass Effect, covering all past, present, and future innovations within that universe. Meanwhile, Tech Tree Points enable access to entire tech trees, granting you the collective advancements of all factions and species within a given setting. These tech trees are broader and more comprehensive, but their costs reflect their increased scope and value.  
The cost of accessing catalogs or tech trees varies based on their complexity, rarity, and potential impact. For instance, in the Mass Effect universe, a Human Technology Catalog costs 10 points, while species-specific catalogs for the Asari or Turians are priced according to the sophistication of their contributions. Catalogs for ancient or extinct civilizations, such as the Reapers or Protheans, are the most expensive due to their advanced and enigmatic nature.  
Unlocking the entire Mass Effect Tech Tree, which consolidates all species and factions, requires approximately 100 points. Specialized catalogs, such as those focusing on Material Science for creating advanced materials or FTL Technology for faster-than-light travel, are also available. These targeted options allow you to tailor your acquisitions to meet specific needs or goals.  
Points are earned through gameplay achievements, such as completing quests, exploring dungeons, overcoming significant challenges, and altering the destinies of worlds. The more difficult the task, the greater the rewards. Additionally, the system provides a daily allowance of 1 point for each currency type, ensuring consistent progress.  
Every week, you’ll receive a curated selection of ten settings from which you can unlock tech trees and catalogs. You can purchase as many as your points allow, with all acquisitions becoming permanent additions to your archive. The selection refreshes monthly, offering new opportunities to expand your repository. If you have high system intelligence, you may request specific settings to unlock; however, this comes at an increased cost.  
Once technologies are unlocked, they become a permanent part of your system. This grants you the ability to combine innovations from different worlds and create entirely new advancements that transcend the limitations of individual universes. For example, you could integrate FTL propulsion with Typhon-derived materials or merge Asari biotics with Cyberpunk neural interfaces. The Tech System is more than an archive; it’s a tool for creativity and unprecedented technological progress.


**Gudako!**
Cost: 50 SP

You have the ability to randomly get a single 'item', 'power' or 'person' of significance in fiction per 'roll'. They generally manifest in form of cards which you can use to summon them, however you may choose how they manifest. Other than the above specified items, you can also get power boosting and weakness removal cards which you can use for both yourself and your summon. The rarity of the card determines how bad a weakness can be removed. Any changes to the world caused by this power is retroactive and would not cause any suspicion among the residents of the world.  
Any powers or items you get work no matter what universe you are in. Similarly, people summoned by the gacha also have their power unchanged. The people summoned by the Gacha while not completely loyal to you, are willing to work with you if you don't go too much against their principles (your relationship with them is similar to Master-Servant relationship from Fate).  
  
You also possess three command seals (refreshed daily) that you can use to give them an absolute order. Any item you get from gacha repairs itself with time if broken, with stronger items taking more time for repair. Any summoned person who died can only be resurrected with the use of resurrection card (that you may get from gacha) or some other resurrection power. This power by itself doesn't have any innate ability to resurrect them.  
You get a single gacha point daily and can get more when you defeat your enemies, interact with people important to plot and complete or change plot points of your world. The number of points you get varies from one to ten, depending upon the power of your enemies, importance of the person in plot and how major plot points you have completed or change. An example being preventing Scion from destroying earth will give you ten points. Similarly meeting the protagonist will also give you ten points because of their central role in the story.  
The tiers of your items, summons and powers are: F, E, D, C, B, A, S, SS and SSS with F being Junk items, E being an item like "always filled water bottle" and SSS being top tier divine abilities and authorities (taken into account that you are a non-powered mortal). If you roll five junks (F tier) one after another, you get a pity point, preventing you from getting a junk in the next roll.  
Your power generally manifest in the form of a HUD, where you can spin a wheel to get your items. Or you can freely design how it appears.  
(You may choose to not absorb the power you get from Gacha and give it to someone else. You may also choose to give the items you get to others. However, any power or item you get from this Gacha, will never be able to hurt you. The rate of getting items from higher tiers decreases exponentially from F tier, with SSS tier having the lowest probability. The items and power you get from the Gacha varies depending on your base power level, such that no item or power is totally useless to you (except if you roll F tier). The probability of getting same items or powers is extremely low, and in case you get the same item or power, you can sacrifice one of them to strengthen the other.)

*Whale IT!*
Required: The Celestial Market (World Seed Jump - Anon303)

With the Celestial Market, you've just unlocked an exciting new feature called the Cash Shop for Gudako!. By spending CC, you can purchase a variety of items designed to enhance your experience and support Gudako! such as reducing the repair timer, acquiring powerful support cards (such as resurrection and weakness removal), buying additional Gacha points, unlocking costumes for your summoned persons, buying gifts for your summons to increase their affection towards you, and even activating new features for Gudako! such as a dorm room for your summons to reside which will increase their affection, and accelerates their recovery.

*Essence Of The Gacha (Meta Essence CYOA)*
Required: Template Cosplay

You have the ability to randomly summon one important item or person from fiction per roll. These entities appear on cards that can be summoned, but once summoned, they cannot revert back. You have access to a list of all cards and options to narrow your search. Cards can enhance summoned items, people, or yourself, but they are destroyed in the process. The strength boost depends on the card’s rarity, based on the being's or item’s importance. additionally you can treat character cards as template options above the current strength restrictions for template choosing.  
Summoned items will always function regardless of the universe and remain in perfect condition. They can only be used by you unless others have your permission. Items with resources, like energy or ammunition, are infinitely supplied but can't be siphoned. Summoned people will be loyal, cannot harm or kill you, and will always be restored to full health if injured. They may disobey orders they dislike, as long as they don’t involve you directly.  
You form a bond with each summoned person, starting at level 0 (stranger) and rising to 10 (total devotion). You receive 1 gacha point per day, with the option to buy more at $1 per point, up to $100 a month. There are three gacha modes: the first lets you spend 3 points for a guaranteed 3-star card, with a chance for 4-star or higher, or 30 points for 10 cards, including at least one 3-star and one 4-star card. The second mode offers 10 free cards per day, limited to 1-3 stars. The third mode lets you summon items and people from your current universe, costing 6 or 60 points, with a minimum of 4-star cards. This mode works only if the universe has 4-star or higher cards available. You may decide how this Essence manifests.

*Infinite Gudako!*
Required:Infinite Gacha (Mugen Gacha Level 9999)

With the Infinite Gacha, you draw energy from both the environment and within yourself to create gacha points. In a low-energy or magic-less environment, a normal person can only generate about three normal gacha points per day before becoming exhausted.  
  
However, you can also adjust the energy you invest in each gacha point, allowing you to influence both the quantity and quality of the cards you receive. Spending less energy per point lets you generate more points but confines you to common rank rolls such as E-rank or F-rank rolls. On the other hand, investing more energy increases your chances of obtaining high rank rolls like A-rank or even SSS-rank rolls with your points. Additionally, you can choose to focus a gacha point on one of three categories—items, summons, or powers, but doing so significantly raises the energy cost per point.

**Gacha Hunter**
Cost: 10 SP

As a Gacha Hunter, your victories over enemies may yield exciting rewards in the form of mystical cards. When broken, these cards have the potential to grant you a wide array of skills, powers, or items related to the enemy you defeated. Whether it's acquiring the world-ending blade of a Demon Lord or gaining the culinary expertise of a Master Chef, the possibilities are endless.  
  
However, obtaining these valuable cards is not guaranteed. The chances of acquiring a card greatly increase when you defeat enemies near your own level or even stronger opponents. Therefore, prepare yourself for epic battles against formidable foes, as they are more likely to bestow upon you a chance to get powerful and rare cards.  
These cards can hold immense worth in the world, as apart from enhancing your own capabilities, you also have the option to trade or sell them to interested parties. Play it right and the market value of these cards could become astronomical, and even a handful of them can bring you immense wealth and recognition.  
It's important to note that you can even gain cards from repeatedly defeating the same enemy. However, there is a 24-hour cooldown period before you have the chance of obtaining another card from that particular enemy. This adds an element of anticipation and strategy to your hunts, as you must carefully plan your encounters and manage your resources.  
Embrace the thrill of the hunt, seize victory over your adversaries, and unlock the vast potential hidden within these coveted cards. May your journeys be filled with exhilarating battles and bountiful loots!

**Roguelite Survivor**
Cost: 20 SP

As a Roguelite Survivor, failure is never the end—it’s just another step in your endless journey of growth. This ability works in two folds, firstly anytime you defeat or kill an enemy, it grants you EXP that fills up a bar that when full grants you a choice of three semi random upgrades, abilities, gear or weapons based on an aesthetic of your choice (fantasy, sci-fi, modern military hardware/ordinance or even choices based on other universes like Warframe, bloodborne etc.), regardless of what aesthetic you picked the choices you get would have ‘gamelike’ attributes to them like crit chances and elemental effects for example  
Which means that even if you pick medieval as your aesthetic, you can in time have chain mail that negates 80% of any type of damage, crossbows that shoot seeming normal bolts that can wipe out armies due to crit chance and explosive type damage etc., The possibilities are endless and what's more is that you can change the aesthetic anytime you want.  
The gear, items or weapons you get are kept in a practically limitless storage space that you can easily access by willing it to get them and what's more, the passive abilities the items give you will still be active even if the item in particular is in your storage space so you don't have to worry about lumbering with hundreds things on your person.  
The second aspect of this power is that every time you are killed, you disintegrate and come back to life in a safe spot, But lose almost all your accumulated skills and abilities gained by this ability but do not fret too much, like any other roguelite, you have a second upgrade path that allows you to upgrade yourself with choices that carry over between ‘runs’.  
Note: the resurrection aspect of this power is not absolute, a sufficiently powerful wizard, reality warper etc. can erase you from existence, and you have no protections against retroactive attacks with this alone

**Universal Aptitude**
Cost: 5 SP

Your Universal Aptitude allows you to comprehend any skill, practice, or discipline, in the universe no matter its complexity. From the simplicity of juggling to the depths of ancient magic, and even extending to reality-bending or cosmic manipulations, there is no limit to what you can learn. This ability enables you to master concepts that appear mutually exclusive, showcasing your extraordinary ability to absorb and understand even the most esoteric subjects.  
  
This aptitude ensures you can achieve a novice level of proficiency with ease across any field. As long as you have teaching materials or examples of the practice/skill you can easily grasp the basics in no time. However, progressing beyond this initial stage demands more than this natural talent alone; it does not offer any shortcuts to advanced expertise.  
  
Additionally, while your aptitude spans all subjects, it doesn’t grant you the specific energies, physical conditions, or capabilities needed to fully utilize these powers. Even if you have an aptitude for it you can’t use the practice or skill if you don’t have the requirements to use it. For instance, understanding the principles of shard powers is one thing, but wielding them without the requisite shard biology is impossible. Your aptitude is tied to the rules of the universe you inhabit, your power's foundation is rooted in the norms of the world you first appear in. To extend its reach, you must reside in a new universe for at least 6 months, after which your aptitude will adapt to encompass everything within that realm as well.  
The journey to harness your full potential rests solely in your hands.
*Curiosity Catalyst*

Your pursuit of knowledge has transcended superficiality, allowing you to delve into each subject covered by your aptitude with passion. Your mind is a constant whirlwind of discovery, always asking questions, seeking answers, and leading you to breakthroughs and innovations.  
The universe is vast, and your thirst for its knowledge is endless. You will never tire of learning about its wonders. You may turn off the Curiosity Catalyst at any time you wish, and it will never negatively influence your mental state, so don’t worry about becoming a mad scientist.
UPGRADE
**Universal Power Plant**
Cost: 5 SP
Required:Universal Aptitude

Inside you, there is a malleable source of energy. When you visit a new universe, if there is a power system reliant on some specific type of supernatural energy, your internal source will evolve to allow you to emulate it. This also speeds up the process of acquiring new aptitudes, now requiring only a month to do so.

*Instant Adaptation*
Required: Engine of Escalation, or VitaSync
No longer do you need to wait months for the adaptation to kick in. Now, the moment you encounter any new type of supernatural energy, be it magic, psionic, or anything else, your source will instantly adapt to emulate the newly encountered energy. You will also gain the basic understanding on how to manipulate these new energies, but will still have to wait around a week for more deep understanding, although this time can be drastically cut down with practice.



**A Step Beyond**
Cost: 7 SP

Any skill you may have, be it cooking, martial arts, or even walking, can be pushed beyond the level of mundane, all while remaining mundane in nature. The more often you use a skill, the better it gets, taking the skill to its logical extreme. Casually cooking a few times a day will result in your cooking dramatically improving, reaching the level far beyond any mundane cooking in a year. Actively practicing and learning to improve a skill will drastically increase the rate of its improvement.  
With enough time and effort, your cooking could cause even the most vicious demons to be kind, your martial arts could defeat armies, or you singing can bewitch fairies. Just note that you may reach bottlenecks at times, as it will require certain mindsets or understandings to further improve a skill.
*A World Beyond*
Required:The Chad Grindset Enjoyer

Engaging with life's basics fuels a deep understanding, elevating you beyond mere observation to an intuitive grasp of reality.  
  
This enlightenment enhances every skill you possess. For instance, in cooking, after a year of casual practice, you don't just follow recipes; you blend flavors with an instinctual mastery, creating dishes that defy convention, perhaps even granting immortality.  
This enlightenment permeates all your abilities, whether in art, music, or combat, elevating them to miraculous levels. Ultimately, you embody the limitless potential of human experience, constantly reshaping reality with each action.
*Existence Beyond it All*
Required:VitaSync

As you journey through the vast expanse of existence, every facet of your being undergoes a metamorphosis, evolving in tandem with your deepening understanding of reality.  
Your abilities, honed by passive observation, transcends its very nature, fortifying your body, sharpening your mind, and enriching your soul. Each passing day enriches the tapestry of your existence, empowering your physical form to ascend beyond the bounds of mortality. Your flesh becomes impervious, your beauty irresistible, and even the resonance of your voice carries a potent sway over those who hear it.  
This evolution is not instantaneous, requiring the patient passage of time to unfurl its transformative magic, yet diligent training and profound introspection can hasten its pace, unlocking untold potential within.  
So it begins, the Apotheosis.

**Pioneer of the Stars (Type-Moon)**

Cost: 10 SP

A unique Skill granted to those who served as turning points in humanity's history. It bestows the ability to transform what's deemed _"impossible"_ into a possibility—_"events that can be realized."_  
Strictly speaking, this power does not directly produce results on its own. But rather, lets you break through the perceived limits of whatever you set your focus on, enabling you to glimpse a future where the impossible becomes attainable. Even conceptual impossibility isn't exempt; as the Skill opens a path for you to escape inevitability itself, creating a chance—however slim—for success in any endeavor, so long as you have the will and put in the effort to pursue it.  
  
With enough dedication, this Skill allows for feats such as attaining immense magical prowess despite having access to limited magical energy, or bringing knowledge that should lie far outside the reaches of humanity down to a level anyone can understand, etc.

**Base Building Game**
Cost: 30 SP

You have been granted a base-building system to establish your dominion. You begin with a castle and two workers. The castle serves as your primary base and can be customized in both style and decoration to match your preferences. Your workers are Golems, capable of constructing various mundane and supernatural buildings, crafting magical equipment and consumables, or gathering resources.  
  
At the start, you can construct the following buildings:  
Resource Center – Produces common resources such as different types of stone, wood, minerals, and metals.  
Farm – Generates crops and animal products.  
Recruitment Center – Allows you to summon or induct others as units under your control. Those under your rule gain a weaker version of the Gamer System.  
Training Center – Enables your units to train, acquire new skills, and enhance their abilities at an accelerated rate.  
Research Center – Facilitates the discovery of new technologies and magic, as well as the ability to transfer your knowledge directly to chosen individuals.  
Exploration Portal – Grants access to resource-rich but dangerous locations where rare materials can be obtained.  
Mission Hall – Provides missions for your units to complete, yielding various rewards.  
Production Center – Supports raw material processing, equipment creation and repair, and the production of additional workers.  
Guard Tower – A defensive structure that fires projectiles at hostile enemies.  
Wall – Supernaturally reinforced barriers designed to keep out invaders.  
  
Each building enhances the efficiency of its respective activities tenfold. For example, a farm will produce ten times the output of a normal farm of the same size in just one-tenth of the time, while training and research centers dramatically accelerate their respective processes.  
As you gather resources, you can upgrade your castle, unlocking additional building types as well as allowing existing buildings to be upgraded to a higher level.  
Upgraded buildings besides further improvement of their efficiency boost can also unlock new functions. For example, advanced farms and resource centers can produce rare or exotic materials. However, the level of your castle determines the maximum level your buildings can reach. Higher-level structures require more resources, including rare and exotic materials, for both construction and upgrades.  
Like your units, you also have access to a weaker version of the Gamer System. However, if you possess the full Gamer System ability or any similar RPG-based power, such as Falna, you can bestow that system upon your units instead.

*Faithful Civilization*
Required: Sovereign Domain
Required: Path to Divinity
Required: Lucid Conjuration

Congratulation! Your guarantee to become a God, your ability to dictate laws in your owned lands, and the newfound sapience of your units have resulted in the Base Building Game power being boosted! Now, instead of only building a town that you rule, you can build a whole civilization. This civilization will always worship you, resulting in Path to Divinity’s growth being boosted enough that you get a Divine Domain right at the start! However, this domain will be restricted to Street-Tier level like if gotten with Fragmented Divinity (In fact, just use the rules of how that works to choose your domain.).  
You can also bestow permanent blessings on a certain amount of individuals, starting at 5 individuals. To be able to bless more individuals, you will have to make the next jump for your civilization, aka: Tribe to Small Town, Small Town to Town, Town to Large Town, Large Town to Small City, etc. Each stage will grant you 5 more “Blessing Slots”. Keep in mind however that those blessed individuals can only have up to 3 different blessings each.  
Sovereign Domain is also boosted, resulting in the amount of time needed to claim a territory being reduced to a week as long as you are the one that holds the majority of the territory.  
  
There are a few more buildings you can build now, those are:  
Church: This building boosts the Faith you gain from your worshiper that goes there.  
Graveyard: This building lets those who died still contribute a small amount to your Faith need as long as those individuals are buried there.  
Holy Order: This Building lets you recruit a Paladin or Priest; Paladins are guards or combatants that can use a portion of your domain for combat while Priests are the same except for more support/healing needs.
