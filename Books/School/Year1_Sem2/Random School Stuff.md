Hi Kathleen,
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">I really enjoyed reading your critique essay. I find it to be detailed, based on a close reading Of the text. The
examples you review clearly indicate that you have closely familiarized yourself with the article. Here are some
comments for you to consider:</mark>

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Your thesis statement is clearly the final sentence of the introduction paragraph, in which the you have stated their
overall evaluation and previewed some of the main ideas.
However, there is another sentence preceding it which also presents an evaluation of the source article.
Ideally, these two sentences must be merged into one for a more effective thesis. It is not clear what direction you
want to take. One of your sentences indicates a positive evaluation of the source article, while another sentence
hints at problems with the source. I suggest you merge these into one and follow the parallel structure format to
preview the main ideas in the same order in which they appear in the response section.</mark>

<mark class="hltr-yellow">The summary is 183 words long. This exceeds the 10-15% range requirement.
The student can remove some details and delete some contextual elements in order to bring down the word count.</mark>

<mark class="hltr-yellow">Headings have been included for each of the response sections. However, many of these headings are broad and
generic and should be revised and made more specific.</mark>

<mark class="hltr-green">Overall, I feel you can deliver a very structured response by addressing these comments. Once again, thank you for
giving me a chance to review your work.</mark>
