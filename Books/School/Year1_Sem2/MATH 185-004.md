Test and quizzes on thursday class (8 am - 11:59 pm)

**Class 1 (1/8/2025)**
- Inductive Reasoning and Deductive Reasoning

Inductive: drawing a general conclusion from repeated observations of specific examples
Deductive: applying general principles to specific examples

Premise: Assumption, law, rule, widely held idea or observation

**Class 2 (1/10/2025)**
Examples of reasoning:
Inductive reasoning

37 x 6 = 222
37 x 9 = 333
37 x 12= 444

- Number Sequences
*Number Sequence*
A list of numbers having a first number, a second number, a third number, and so on. These are the terms of the sequence.
*Arithmetic Sequence*
A sequence that has a common difference between successive terms.
*Geometric Sequence*
A sequence that has a common ratio between
successive terms.

*Sum of the First n Odd Counting Numbers*
If n is any counting number, then
1+3+5+..•+ (2n —l) = n^2
Special Sum Formulas
For any counting number n, the following are true.
(1+2+3+...+ n)^2 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 ... + n^3

Pentagonal Number Equation:
p =

Cardinality: Size of set ({2,6,7} = 3)
Equation: 
A = {108, 109, 110, 111,..., 134}      
First term - last term + 1 = (134-108) + 1 = 27

Set equality: Set contains the same elements (ignore repetition of terms). {1,5,6} = {5,5,5,6,1}

**Class 3 (1/15/2025)**
- Complements of a set
For any set *A* within the universal set *U*, the complement of A, written A', is the set of all elements of *U* that are not elements of *A*. That is: A'= {x | x E U and x E/ A}.

If A is a subset of B (all of A's elements are also elements of B)
A c_ B
Proper subset = c

Suppose A and B are sets. Then A = B if
c_ B and B c_ A are both true.

Set A is a proper subset of set B if and A c_ B adn A \= B
This is written as A c B.

- Subsets
*Number of Subsets* Formula: 2^n (n is the number of elements in the set)
The *number of proper subsets* of a set with n elements is 2^n — 1

The *complement of the universal set*, U, is the empty set, ∅ and the complement of the empty set is the universal set. In set notation, this is: U ′ = ∅ and ∅ ′ = U .

**Class 4 (1/17/2025)**
- Set Theory

- Intersection of Sets**
The intersection of sets A and B, written A u B,  
is the set of elements common to both A and B, or: A u B = {x | x e A and x  e B}

Example Intersections: 
a) {1,3,5,7,9} u {1,2,3,4,5,6}
b) {2,4,6} u 0/
Solution (basically shared elements in both sets)
a){1,3,5} 
b) 0/

- Union of Sets**
a) {1,3,5,7,9} u {1,2,3,4,5,6}
b){2,4,6}u 0/

Solution (basically adding them together, no duplicate elements)
a) {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9}
b) {2,4,6}

- Difference of Sets**
• Difference of two sets: A—B is the set of all elements belonging to set A and not to set B.
Example: {2,4,6} - {1,2,3,4,5} = {6}

Upside down U (intersection)= ONLY elements in common
Upside U (union) = elements from sets combined
A' = elements from U (universal) not in set A
A - B = ONLY elements from A that are not in B

Disjoint sets: two sets which have no elements in common. A upsidedownu B = 0/

In the ordered pair (a, b), a is called the first component and b is called the second component. In general (a,b) =\= (b, a).
Two ordered pairs are equal provided that their first components are equal and their second components are equal.

**Class 5 (1/22/2025)**
Number theory is the branch of mathematics devoted to the study of the properties of the
natural numbers.
Natural numbers are also known as counting numbers or the positive integers.

- Prime and Composite Numbers
Prime = 1 and iteself as factors (natural number greater than 1), composite is not a prime number

One systematic method for identifying primes is known as the Sieve of Eratosthenes. To construct a sieve, list all the natural numbers from 2 through some given natural number. The number 2 is prime, but all multiples of it are composite. Circle the 2 and cross out all other multiples of 2. Continue this process for all primes less than or equal to the square root of the last number in the list. Circle all remaining numbers that are not crossed out.

**Class 6 (1/24/2025)**
5.1 Number Theory Cont.

Divvisbility Tests

Every Natural number can be expressed as a product of primes
*Prime Factorization* is finding which prime numbers multiply together to make the original number.

**Class 7 (1/29/2025)**
Ch4 ext Modular Systems

Residue of a Large Number

Given any whole number a, no matter how large, find the number b in the set
{1,2,,4 ..., n — 1} such that a= b(mod n).
b is the remainder whn a is divided by n

In a modular system, the residue modulo n for a number a can be found by completing these three steps, in turn.
Step 1 Divide a by the modulus n.
Step 2 Subtract the integer part of the quotient to obtain only the fractional part.
Step 3 Multiply the fractional part of the quotient by n.
Th final result is the residue modulo n.

The residue of a product equals the product of the residues
Eg Find the residue of 353328 x 6779944, mod 23.

**Class 9 (1/13/2025)**
- Ch. 5.1, 5.4, 5 ext (Modern Cryptography)

Key Components:
-Encryption: Converts plaintext to ciphertext.
-Decryption: Converts ciphertext back to plaintext.
-Algorithm: A mathematical function used to encrypt and decrypt data.
-Key: Additional secret information used in cryptographic functions.

Symmetric Cryptography:
-Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
-Examples: AES, DES, 3DES

Asymmetric Cryptography:
-Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
-Examples: RSA, ECC, Diffie-Hellman

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
C = M^k (mod n)

- Alice 's Actions
Choose a value of a. (Keep this value secret.)
Compute al = M^a (mod n). 
Send the value of al to Bob.
Receive the value of ß from Bob.
Compute the key: K = ß^a (mod n).
	
- Bob 's Actions
Choose a value of b. (Keep this value secret.)
Compute ß = M^b (mod n).
Send the value of ß to Alice.
Receive the value of al from Alice.
Compute the key: K = al^b (mod n).


This last factor is too large to handle like the others. Due to the way we "split up" the exponent, subsequent powers of 89 can be written as powers of earlier ones.
89^2 = 4 (mod)

89^8 = (89^2)^4   [a^mn = (a^m)^n]
= (4^4) [89^2 = 4 (mod)]
= 74 (mod)

**Class 12 (2/12/2025)**
- 10.2: Fundamental Counting Principle

*Uniformity Criterion*: A multiple-part task is said to satisfy the uniformity criterion if the number of choices for any particular part is the same no matter which choices were selected for the previous parts.

When a task consists of k separate parts and satisfies the uniformity criterion, if the first part can be done in n1 ways, the second part can be done in n2 ways, and so on through the k th part, which can be done in nk ways, then the total number of ways to complete the task is given by the product: n1 * n2 * n3... nk
