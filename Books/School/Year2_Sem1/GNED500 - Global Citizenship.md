## Global Citizenship

**Globalization**

The increasing integration of nation's economies, trade, ideas and cultures. 

Globalization and capitalism are closely linked.


**History of Globalization**
1st wave of globalization has a legacy of colonization - 1870s - lasted until the 1st world war
• The first wave of globalization has a legacy in colonization. Many of the trade
measures that are in place today can be traced back to the colonial structures of that time

2nd wave of globalization (1950-1980) - new trade agreement - cartels like OPEC
• New trade agreements and cartels like OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries) were formed during that time period to encourage a global economy

3rd wave of globalization - started early 1980s - technologies - leads to marginalization
• The third wave of globalization started in the early 1980s.
• Advances in communication technologies made this stage evolve quickly.

**Impacts of 3rd wave of Globalization**
"globalization from above" - corporate globalization driven by big business
• Serves World Bank, IMF, big economies
• They use hegemony (process of building consent through social practices) of the "haves" over the "have-nots"
(example of hegemony: govt increasing taxes, you don't consent but do it anyways)

"globalization from below" - includes social movements, non-govt organizations (NGOs),
• Citta slow - (slow city) - slow movement - (international network of small
towns) - 100 countries - 'slow living movement' (slow eating) as opposed to
'globalization' (fast food)

**Cosmopolitanism**

Immanuel Kant believed that being a cosmopolitan means we have moral obligations towards one another.
We are all humans and our moral obligations are rooted in our shared humanity
Cosmopolitanism basically means you think of yourself as a citizen of the world (or from the world)

**Global Citizenship**
At its most basic level, Global Citizenship is the idea that we belong to a shared community of human beings.
This means that we think of ourselves not strictly as citizens of a particular nation, but as citizens of the whole world.
To understand the concept of global citizenship we need to begin with its foundations

Global Concerns global citizens are concerned with:
1. Economic fairness
2. Equitable distribution of resources
3. Education
4. Poverty alleviation
5. Cultural identity
6. The Environment
7. Human rights
8. Health
9. Gender equality
10. Globalization
11. Social Justice

**Global Citizenship Study reasons:** 
Builds the practice of big-picture thinking - contextualize world events, interconnectivity of global issues
Develops interpersonal skills - problem solving, cultural awareness, critical thinking, teamwork skills, communication skills
Dispels stereotypes through learning about others - challenges age-old assumptions and to assess one's personal heritage through
self-reflective practices

Characteristics of GC

Global citizenship means
1. being able to see the interdependence of nations and interconnectivity of human activities
2. to speak against injustices around the world
3. to be aware of the process of policy formation
4. to understand people of diverse cultures, and to learn from interactions with them
5. to respect and value diversity
6. to understand how the world works economically, politically, socially, culturally, etc.
7. to participate in and contribute to the community locally and globally
8. to act to make the world more sustainable place
9. to have a strong sense of empathy that informs social action around the world
10. to take responsibility for their actions
11. 


Two fundamental perspectives:
1. Global state of mind
2. Ethical implications

**Negative Effects of Globalization**
Globalization creates demand for low paying workers often done by minorities like immigrants, women and POC.





# Class 2 (Sept 8)


**Sociology of Identity**

Social structures and cultures

Identity is complex.

**2 frameworks**
*Essentialism:* Identity we are born with. Core self.  Ethnicity etc.
DNA
fingerprints
body odor?
biologically unique traits

*Social Constructionism:*  Identities are shaped by external factors such as social institutions, social structures and people. Shaped by society
Friends and family
School
Teachers
Cultures
religion
Media

**Social Structure**
Social status: position a person has in society

Divided into: ascribed vs achieved categories

*ascribed* (sex, ethnicity, age): status that is given to you at birth over which you have no control
*achieved* (job):  a position over which one has control over.

**Agents of Socialization**
*Socialization:* The process, through interactions with others, by which we come to understand different social statuses and the roles, or behavioral expectations.

Socialization as a lifelong process begins when we are young.
Think of babies: parents spend a considerable amount of time teaching babies how and when to sleep, eat, and communicate. We are taught how to behave in society and to be aware of social expectations.

Throughout our lives we are exposed to many agents of socialization, including:
parents
teachers/schools
media
youth groups
religious institutions
friends and families

Most powerful socializing influence on identities is mass media.

**"Me" and "I"**
Two aspects of self
According to George Mead, the "Me" is oneself as others see you, whereas the 'I' is how one thinks of themselves.
The "l" is the part of you that presents itself to and interacts with others. When it does this, it uses information it receives from the me.

**Looking-Glass self**
Our identities are formed through the way we imagine we are seen by others
We imagine how our personality and appearance seem to other people and how they might judge us, and we adjust our identity (or self-concept) accordingly.

**Dramaturgical Approach**
Each *individual is an actor* and those around them *constitute the different audiences* whose opinions and impressions must be managed.
• For example, when a student fails a test, she may say to her professor that she tried her best but did not understand the material.
• But then this same student may later tell her classmates that she hardly studied.

**Front-Stage and Back-Stage Behaviour**
• According to Goffman, *Front-stage behaviour* is the behaviour that we exhibit when in public or around less familiar acquaintances.
• *Back-stage behaviour* is the behaviour that we exhibit only when alone or around more intimate acquaintances.
• In the front-stage we are more consciously aware of how we are being perceived; whereas, in the back-stage we are less anxious about how we might be judged due to our trust and familiarity with those closest to us.

**Colonialism, Orientalism and Identity**
• One of the ways our knowledge and understanding of identities has been shaped is through a historical process known as colonialism.
• Colonialism can typically be understood as the political, economic or cultural domination of more powerful nations over less powerful countries
• For example, First Peoples in Canada, like other Indigenous groups across the world, continue to be treated as inferior by the government.
*Colonization:* a powerful country forces less powerful nations to exist and function using its own language, customs, practices and art, which it deems superior

*Orientalism:* Orientalism is a concept developed by Edward Said (2003) to explain how colonizing countries (mostly in Western Europe and North America) defined and identified people from other parts of the world.
Orientalists described these colonized people as "other," different, abnormal, exotic, backward, savage, inferior, etc. 

Orientalism is alive today in the form of Muslim negative portrayal in western media

# Class 3 (Sept 10)

Assignment 1 Due Sept 19 

To what extent is your identity connected to the characteristics of global citizenship

**Identity and Social Topics**

*Stereotype:* A generalization of a group of people
Can be negative or positive

*Stereotype:* “A widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person” or group.

*Prejudice:* A “preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience”  
*Discrimination:* The unjust or unfair treatment of different categories of people, especially based on their race, age, or sex. 

**Stereotype threat**
• One of the dangers of stereotypes is that the people being stereotyped may start
to believe these false characterizations are true.
• Stereotype threat is the effect of negative stereotypes on an individual's
performance or behaviour.
• Stereotype threat: poor performance in the face of negative stereotypes.
• Stereotype: Asians are good at math. (Asian heritage)
• Stereotype: (Gender) Women can't do math.
• Two groups of Asian female college students were given a math test. Before the
test, one group was given a survey that highlighted their Asian identity. The other
group was given a survey that highlighted the fact that they were female.
• The group who were made sensitive to their Asian heritage performed better on
the test than the group made sensitive to their gender.

**Intersectionality**
• People can be discriminated against based on statuses such as gender,
race, sexuality, ethnicity, culture, class, caste, religion, (dis)ability, body size
and shape, etc.
• E g An overweiqht woman of visible minority may be body shamed and also called racial ethnic slurs.
• People are often discriminated against based on two or more statuses.
• We could be disadvantaged based on gender and race and sexuality, or any combination of the above.
• Academics and activists refer to the experience of discrimination from a number of different directions as intersectionality.
• prejudice -> Discrimination -> Inequality = Injustice ->
violence, chaos, agitation, crime

**Gender, Sex, Intersex**
• In order to understand gender identities as socially constructed, we have to begin with a distinction between sex and gender.
• Sex: the biological differences between male and female.
	• These categories are not always as discrete as they may seem.

• Intersex: refers to people who have both male and female genital characteristics.
• Bisexual: Attraction to both male and female
• Asexual, Coming out, LGBTQIA2S+
• Gender: refers to the characteristics of being "masculine" and being "feminine."

**Gender and Performativity**
• Judith Butler argues that 'masculine' belongs to male' and 'feminine'
belongs to 'female' is false. "Performance" is everything
• Men may not necessarily feel or act "masculine" and women may not necessarily feel or act "feminine." Think of Tomboys.
• Gender is something we learn. It is not something we are born with.
• Girls - pink, dolls
• Boys - blue, trucks

**Gender socially constructed**
• Thus, we can say that gender, unlike sex, is a social construct and that we are socialized into gender roles.
• From a very young age, boys are taught to be boys, while girls are taught to be girls.
• Whereas girls are encouraged to be "cute" and "sweet," boys are encouraged to be "aggressive" and "strong."
• The important thing to note is that those who fail to do their gender correctly are often bullied, called names, and treated badly.

**Sexuality**
• Sexuality: refers to sexual preferences and orientation.
• Just as we have expectations of appropriate gender roles, we also have expectations of appropriate sexual roles.
• Men are expected to be sexually aggressive, women to be passive.
• Women who assert themselves sexually are called "sluts."
• We assume that sexuality is synonymous with heterosexuality.
• As such, we often assume that heterosexuality is "normal" and "natural" while homosexuality is framed as "deviant" and "unnatural.
• People who fail to conform to acceptable sexual roles are often punished. 
For instance, gays and lesbians are often the target of discrimination.

**Gender and Power**
Masculinity is stereotypically associated with the qualities of being strong, rational, independent, intelligent, and aggressive.
Femininity is typically associated with the qualities of being nurturing, emotional, weak, kind, maternal, etc.
These stereotypes can feed into gender inequality.

**Social Construct of Race**
The popular assumption is that race is associated with genetic or physical differences, particularly those based on skin color.

Race represents one of the social statuses that is socially constructed but that has a
significant influence on our identities.

Political and social factors, more than
science and biology, provided us the categories of race that we are familiar with today.

So race is linked to the exercise of power.

**RACE**
Historically, race was a concept used to dominate certain groups of people and to take away their land.

Notion of difference combined with theories of superiority and inferiority justifies colonial
expansion and exploitation.

Race as a concept only really developed during the late 18th century.

The concept of race was used to control, marginalize, and oppress large segments of the population.

Indigenous
There is no generally accepted definition of Indigenous Peoples in a global context.

Indians, Native, First Nations,
Aboriginal, Aboriginal Peoples,
Indigenous? Métis? Which one is it?

The Canadian Constitution recognizes three groups of Aboriginal peoples:
First Nations, Inuit and Métis.

These are three distinct peoples with unique histories, languages, cultural practices and spiritual beliefs.

**Conclusion**
• Our identities are shaped by social, political, and cultural factors.
• But we also have a certain amount of control over our identities.
• One way we might define ourselves is as global citizens.
• We might think of ourselves as citizens of the world

# Week 3 (Sept 15)
## Class 1

**Ideology shapes the world**

*BELIEF SYSTEM*
• Ideas and values form opinions, make assumptions, and we arrive at conclusions.
• Many of us aren't aware of where these notions come from or how they influence our thinking.

• Most of us assume that our points of view are accurate and truthful.
• We think that they are just common sense.

*Confirmation Bias*
We ignore facts that contradict our perspective or emphasize information favourable to our point of view.
That is the tendency to seek out perspectives that match our beliefs.
This means that we rarely evaluate our perspectives in relation to alternative points of view.

*Ideology*
Think about how our ideas, assumptions, and values are formed!
Root word "idea."
A set of beliefs, ideas, and assumptions accepted as common sense.
Worldviews that shape our perceptions and explanations of the world around us.
Ideologies can be
• cultural, religions, political, legal, social, and/or ethical.
We absorb these particular ideologies through our immersion in social institutions

*Examples of Ideologies*
Individualism: is an ideology that emphasizes self-sufficiency, freedoms, and the inherent worth of each individual.
Religion: are examples of ideologies with ethics, morals.
Capitalism: products and services are best believed to be privately owned and operated for profit.
Socialism: believes that production, distribution, and exchange of goods and services should be under common ownership.
Communism: Classless, stateless society with communal ownership of production.
Fascism: Authoritarian nationalism, suppression of dissent, and state supremacy.
Racism: believes in essential differences and a natural hierarchy between different "races" of people.
Feminism perspectives based on advocating for the economic, social, and political equality between men and women.
*Nationalism* is the idea that our primary loyalty should be to the country in which we live in.
*Imperialism:* The formation of the nation state of Canada is based on the ideology of imperialism, which is based on the idea that the imperial power is culturally,
religiously and economically superior to all other nations or societies, which gives it the right to expropriate land and resources and control the destiny of indigenous populations.
*Secularism:* Separation of religion from state affairs.
Multiculturalism: Celebrating cultural diversity and coexistence.
Neoliberalism views the cause of poverty as problems with the educational system as well as poor choices by the individual.
Neoconservatism believes the cause of poverty as laziness.

**Hegemony**
The process of getting people to accept the interests and values of ruling groups without force is called hegemony
Therefore, Hegemony can also be defined as rule by consent.

**Dominant Ideologies**
• All ideologies exist in relation to each other.
• Different ideologies compete to establish their vision for society
• But certain ideologies resonate more strongly because they are reinforced through social
institutions. We call these dominant ideologies.
• For example, capitalism is a dominant ideology in North America.


Dominant ideologies usually reflect the interests of those in power.
As a result, many of us adopt dominant perspectives on social issues without even
being aware.
They just seem like common sense to us.
We have learned to talk and think about these issues in a particular way - through discourse.

![[Pasted image 20250915203827.png]]

**Dominant Ideologies and Dominant Discourses**
1. Ideologies shape our in individual thinking, but over time, some of them become more influential than others. We call these dominant ideologies.
2. Instead, they represent the extent to which powerful groups in any society are able to shape our ideas, values, and beliefs.
3. Dominant ideologies are often linked together.
4. For instance, as we learned in the "Who is a Canadian?" example, the dominant political ideology of imperialism is linked to the social ideology of white supremacy

**Black and others racialized**
1. We are all influenced by dominant ideologies even if we think we are not.
2. Consider Hollywood films, for example. White men and women have most major roles.
3. Black and other racialized actors usually play minor or stereotypical roles. It is not uncommon to view a Hollywood movie with an entirely white cast.
4. Media reflects the ideological biases of those who control and produce it

**Ideological Framework**

Your beliefs, ideas, and values make up your ideological framework.
This framework is developed over a lifetime of socialization. Many of these interactions are with and within social institutions.

Social institutions include the family, education systems, mass media, and religious institutions.
These institutions transmit dominant ideologies to us. They do this through policies, practices, and norms.
In this way, the ruling ideas of dominant groups operate hegemonically through the creation of common-sense assumptions shared by everyone.

![[Pasted image 20250915205705.png]]


**DISCOURSE**
• Ideologies are shaped through discourse
• Discourse refers to a way of talking and thinking about a particular topic or subject.
• Different occupations and professions will have their own discourses
• E.g. Students in IT, for example, will have a specialized vocabulary as will students in engineering, nursing, and robotics.

**Dominant Discourse**

The dominant ideologies are communicated through dominant discourses.
Dominant discourses can be found in propaganda, cultural messages, and mass media.
For example. in Canada. the dominant discourse that capitalism is the best economic system can be found in media, schools, and popular culture.
Dominant discourses tend to hide negative realities.
1. For example, capitalism poses dangers to our health and environment.
2. It requires the exploitation of certain groups (including children in countries where our goods are made).
3. However, because capitalism is a dominant ideology, people are less likely to believe negative stories about it.

## Class 2 (Sept 17)

**Social Structures and Institutions**

- define social structure and institutions
- purpose of various institutions
- how orgs guide our behaviour

**Rules**
Rules and procedures (the structure) shape our behaviour.
• Different settings and organizations (institutions) have their own rules and procedures
• Rules - written & unwritten
• Within institutions are both written and unwritten rules to shape our behaviour.
• Written rules are official, documented ones, like laws or company policies.
• Unwritten are social norms or cultural practices that aren't formally recorded but are understood.
• For written rules, examples could be legal documents, workplace policies, school codes.
• Unwritten might include social etiquette, workplace culture, family traditions.

**Social Structures & Social Institutions**
• The way a society is organized is called structures.
• The basic elements of a social structure are:
	• E.g., statuses, roles, groups and institutions.
• The way social structures are organized is called institution.
	• E.g., Family, Education, Media, Government, Law
• Social structures are the arrangement of social institutions into relatively stable patterns of social relations.
• They are the actions that are commonly implied (understood as acceptable) in "routine, implicit rule-following activity"

**Roles**
Expected Behaviour

**Social Groups**
Social groups are composed of people who interact frequently and share a common
identity and feelings of interdependence; for example, your classmates, your friends, or your family members.

**Social Institutions**
Social institutions are established areas, organizations, or groups of organizations within a society that coordinate our interactions
Society is structured through its institutions.
In essence, institutions turn individuals into a society.

**Functions of Institutions**
• Education is designed to teach young people specific subjects and skills that may be useful in their lives.
• The law is an organized way to settle disputes between people, to punish those who have hurt others, and to protect communities from those who damage them
by taking unfair advantages for themselves.
• Religion is meant to provide us a moral and ethical framework within which to live our lives and relate to others.
• Mass media is meant to provide entertainment and information to people who are separated over large distances.
• Media also reflects the ideological biases of those who control and produce it.
• All of these are institutions because they exist to serve a social purpose.

Without power we can't create or maintain institutions

# Week 4 (Sept 22) (Technically Week 7?)

## Class 1

**Social Problems**

Reflective Assignment 2

**Individual Problems vs. Social Problems**
In The Sociological Imagination (1959), Sociologist C. Wright Mills drew a distinction between personal troubles and public issues.

According to Mills:
Personal troubles, or individual problems as we'll call them, are things that happen in our individual experience or to the people around us.

In contrast, public issues, or social problems as we'll call them, are "matters that transcend these local environments of the individual and the range of [one's] inner life"

The sociological imagination allows us to think about how changes in social structure may affect our personal experiences.

**sociological imagination**
• When we use the sociological imagination,
1. We collect data, do research, and analyze our findings.
2. Most importantly, we use our critical thinking skills.
3. We try to see beyond our own standpoint—and the prejudices and assumptions we might hold—to formulate
	   • what social problems are, why they exist, and how we may act to create positive, lasting solutions that help as many people as possible.
• In this way, using the sociological imagination is an important aspect of global citizenship.
• It is a methodology for scientific research in social science.


**Individual Problems vs. Social Problems**
• Individual problems may look like misfortune or unluckiness
• An individual problem is something that a single person, or a few individuals, experience.
• An individual problem can be resolve  through individual action
• On the other hand, individual problems may not necessarily be linked to social problems.

• Understanding and solving a social problem requires further investigation and changes to how society is organized (its social structure)
• Social problems, on the other hand, are collectively experienced by people.
• They aren't the sort of thing that individuals can resolve on their own.
• Ultimately, social problems impact individuals.


**Characteristics of Social Problems**
1. A social problem is a social condition or a pattern of behaviour that people believe requires public concern and collective action to bring about change.
2. A social problem is an issue that society agrees is harmful and widespread.
3. We won't all believe that the same issues should be considered social problems for all societies. Social problems are specific to particular societies at a particular time.
4. A social problem exists when there is a sizable difference between the ideals of a society and its reality.
5. Power and exposure influence the extent to which people can be convinced a given issue is a social problem.
6. Social problems are determined not just by the number of people they affect but by how they affect them.
7. Defining a social problem involves convincing the public that both the causes and solutions for a problem lie beyond individual responsibility.

**A Social Problem for Whom?**
• The values of a society distinguish social problems from individual problems.
• But in any society different people will hold different values and beliefs.

**Social Problems in Context**
• The causes of social problems depend on context.
• Our understanding of history is told from the perspective of powerful white men.
• We know a great deal about Christopher Columbus but very little about the people whose land he took over and were massacred.
• Elementary students continue to learn about the heroic acts of European settlers but little about the experiences of First Nations.
• This reminds us that knowledge is not neutral.

**Three Approaches to Framing Social Problems**
Critically Thinking About Social Problems:
• i. As an individual problem
• li. A problem caused by the failure of public institution
• Iii. As a social (systematic) issue. Problems are linked to the very historical, political, social, and economic systems in which they operate.
To understand this framework, let's take the case study of "Youth Unemployment."

![[Pasted image 20250922203901.png]]

## Class 2 (Sept 24)


**Social Analysis**


![[Pasted image 20250924184348.png]]

**Zen Buddhist Fable**
You have come here to learn about us, but your mind is full of your own ideas and assumptions.
You cannot know until you know yourself.
Go empty your mind and then we can talk as equals.

**Social Analysis**
Social analysis is a critical thinking for understanding social problems
It examines why people have conflicting views about the causes and solutions to social problems.
It also considers why harmful conditions continue despite efforts to bring about positive social
change.
It is about looking at an issue from all angles in order to understand how to best approach and, eventually, to attempt to solve a social problem.

**Critical Thinking**
1. Critical thinkers examine the perceptual filters (bias, prejudices, stereotypes etc.) that may influence their ability to evaluate situations objectively or accurately.
2. They recognize the need to be knowledgeable about competing ideologies.
3. This allows them to question the ideas and values they hold.
4. Critical thinkers know the difference between fact and opinion.
5. They recognize misinformation and disinformation.
6. They draw conclusions that are informed and thoughtful.
7. Finally, they recognize the need for good research to engage in solid analysis.

**Social Analysis Importance**
Practice of mindfulness.
Considering the impact that ideas, actions, and behaviours can have
Social analysis is linked to social change.
Challenging discriminatory ideas and participating in the transformation of unjust social and institutional structures.


**Ideologies and Social Institutions**
Dominant ideologies exist, and we follow them often without thinking
*Sources:* Media, government, family, friends, and community
Ideologies are created and maintained through discourses received within social institutions.
Understanding the role of both ideology and social institutions is important for engaging in social analysis.
They help us understand how the individual acts within a social structure.

**Hegemonic Discourse**
Hegemonic Discourses obscure social problems making it difficult to change discriminatory and exploitative social structures.
They function to:
•Misrepresent, omit and distort facts
•Normalize inequality and injustice
•Discredit attempts to achieve meaningful structural change

**Structures of Power**
	• The Structures of Power Diagram illustrates three interconnected structural foundations that societies are built on:
	1. Dominant ideologies articulate the dominant group's vision about how the society should be organized.
	2. Social institutions administer the dominant group's ideological vision of society and legislates and legalizes their power and control.
	3. Dominant discourses reinforce the norms produced by dominant ideologies and institutional practices through common-sense assumptions that shape our understanding of society and social problems.

**Discourse and Social Analysis**
Like ideology, discourse is important to social analysis because discourse is often tied to power.
People with power are able to shape the way we think and talk about things.
Let's continue to look at Youth Unemployment and unemployment in general through the lens of the triangle model of social analysis

# Week 5 

## Class 1 (Sept 29) (Tech. Week 9)


**Social Analysis Framework**

Use the triangle model for last group assignment (or you lose marks)

2 diagrams for group assignment: structure of power and triangle 

Focus on questions
QUESTIONS
1. Where/how/why/when did the problem originate?
2. How has the social problem been challenged historically and by whom?
3. How has the social problem evolved over time? Have there been changes in laws, norms, practices, & policies that affected it?
4. Has it been influenced by societal upheavals? Reforms? Revolution?
5. Why does the problem persist? How is hegemony achieved?
6. How have powerful groups prevented the social problem from being addressed?
Have they made superficial changes that allow them to hold onto power?
Or have they used overt institutional power such as the courts, military, or police forces?


*Triangle Model of Social Analysis*
1. This model helps us understand the origins of social problems and why they continue in spite of social action that seeks to create change.
2. We will look at what shapes our perception of social problems. We consider the role ideologies play.
3. Finally, we will think about how institutions can create and maintain social problems through policies, laws and social norms.
4. By engaging in social analysis, we will be able to find the root causes of social problems.
5. This allows us to evaluate strategies to address them, change our attitudes or behaviours, and take social action.

**How Individuals and Communities Perceive and Experience a Social Problem**

For most of us, how we perceive youth unemployment is shaped by dominant discourses in the media and popular culture.
• In these discourses, there are three main causes of youth unemployment:
 • the failure of public institutions (i.e. education),
 • the failure of public policy (government), and
 • the failure of the individual (too lazy, entitled, or not properly trained)
"when the skills set of a worker does not match the skills demanded by the jobs available" or when workers can't relocate to get available jobs, no mention is
made of any failure of the economic system itself. The individual is to blame."

**How Ideologies and Discourses Relate to the Social Problem**
Where do social problems come from?
One major source is the *ideologies we hold.*
• Ideologies help us to make sense of the world and are transmitted through *socialization by families, schools, and media*.
• They inform our everyday thinking, including our thinking about social problems.
• Despite this, they are invisible to most of us.
• However, failure to consider their effects can skew our understanding of the causes and solutions to social problems and what needs to be done about them.

**How Institutions Perpetuate the Social Problem**
• Institutions such as the media also tend to misrepresent social problems like youth unemployment (Source: Godeanu-Kenworthy, 2020).
• This is because for the most part, media companies are privately owned and tied to the capitalist economic system
(see Media 1 module).
• Corporate media and think-tanks spread discourses that promote the idea that capitalism provides for us all.
• They gloss over the negative aspects of capitalism—like how it creates structural inequality that can affect groups like youth especially hard.
• Dominant discourses promote the view that capitalism is a free-market system. This is a myth.
• Governments regularly help out corporations with bailouts and corporate welfare (like tax breaks and grants).


## Class 2 (Oct 1) (Week 10?)

Discussion Forum 2: explain news article and 2-3 examples of media bias (refer to OER textbook)


**Media**
Media can refer to newspapers, the Internet, magazines, television shows, blogs, social
media sites like Facebook and Twitter, movies, advertisements and so on.

From the time we wake up to the moment we go to sleep, we are constantly surrounded by and engaging with different forms of media.

*MEDIA ASSUMPTIONS*
• We often make assumptions about various forms of media.
*MEDIA IDEOLOGY*
• But the reality is that media affects us in more profound and serious ways than we might even realize

*Assumptions about Media*
• We often make assumptions about various forms of media.
1. We think of news stories as reporting on the truth
2. We think of social media as just a way of sharing information
3. We think of movies and TV shows as a form of escapism
4. We think that advertisements don't have an effect on us.

*Does Media Influence us?*
• Media impacts our understanding. For example, in a democratic society, we often use the media to learn about and interpret
important political issues that affect our communities.
• What we learn from the media then impacts our behaviour.
• The media helps  us determine what we buy, how we vote and how we treat people.
• But the reality is that media affects us in more profound and serious ways than we might even realize.
	• The media affects how we see things.
	• It shapes our perceptions
	• It also feeds into exiting power structures.

**Media Bias**
• Media bias generally refers to the particular slant or perspective of media messages that influences how specific issues or people are presented.
• Biased news reporting influences how the public feels about issues.
1. One way bias in the news can occur is through a process of selection and omission, where an editor may choose to include only some details of a story, while ignoring others.
2. Another way bias can creep in is through the use of negative language
3. Media bias also refers to how media tends to represent and spread dominant ideologies.
4. This can lead to prejudiced attitudes and opinions, as well as stereotyping and discrimination, most often of minoritized and marginalized groups.

**Killing Us Softly**
• One of the first documentaries to critically explore the way women are featured in advertising was Killing Us Softly by Jean Kilbourne
• It was first released in 1979 and has been updated three times since.
• Kilbourne addresses a number of concerns in the video that you might pay attention to.
• While watching the film, take note of what she says about race, sexuality, profit, and the connection between representations and violence.

**Media Consolidation**
The process of concentrating the ownership of media outlets by a small number of large corporations.
1. Who owns the media shapes the images we see and the stories we hear.
2. If you were to look at media in Canada, for instance, you would see that most of the newspapers, radio stations, and television channels are owned by a few large
corporations.
• When two or more media companies work together to produce and control one brand it is called *synergy*
• The control of two or more stages of media production by one media company is called *vertical integration*.

Media can be controlled and owned in various ways which include:
Corporate-controlled media
State-controlled media
Public-controlled media
Citizen-controlled media

Media Representation: Race, Place, People
1. The media often recreates inequalities that exist in our society, but what it chooses to reflect is very selective, e.g., Africa is portrayed as a region marked by corruption, famine, and civil war.
2. Media representation refers to how people, events, places, and stories are presented.
3. Representation is seen in the way people, events, and stories are portrayed:
• what is included and what is not;
• who is included and how;
• and who is left out.

*Representation: Class*
1. Often, we see media representations of wealthy lifestyles.
2. These do not reflect the reality of most citizens.
3. For example, ads do not typically feature working class people.

*Media Regulation*
• Media regulation: Government control of mass media through laws for the purpose of protecting the public interest or promoting
competition among media outlets.
	• Those who control and regulate the media have the power to decide what we might see on television and what remains hidden from us.
	• Media regulation determines what media and media content we have access to.
	• Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)

*Orientalism and Media*
• Orientalism is a concept developed by Edward Said (2003) to explain how colonizing countries (mostly in Western Europe and North America) defined and identified people from other parts of the world. 
• Orientalists described these colonized people as "other," different, abnormal, exotic, backward, savage, inferior, etc.

*Noam Chomsky and the Propaganda Model*
• Philosopher, historian, and social critic, Noam Chomsky, also known as "the father of modern linguistics," says the so-called 'free press' cannot be as free as we think it is.
• Chomsky argued that the media creates "necessary illusions." Chomsky and Herman developed the Propaganda Model" in their book, Manufacturing Consent (1988).
• Chomsky and Herman contend that business entities, government, and collective can exercise considerable influence over media.
The Five Filters used by corporate media to determine what is noteworthy are:
• i. Corporate ownership
• ii. Advertising
• iii. Sourcing
• iv. Negative response to a media statement or program
• v. Creating polar opposites

### Social Media and Disinformation

**Social media and Public Opinion**
• Social media is the new battlefield for public opinion.
- "public" is you and everyone you know.
• On the internet, many individuals and groups try to shape your opinions, whether it's advertisers competing with one another to sell
you products, or politicians trying to get your support.

**Social Media and Interest Groups**
• Social media has a global reach far greater than any other source for information.
• This makes social media platforms a powerful vehicle for interest groups.
• Interest groups use social media to promote their agendas to politicians and the general public.
• Using social media, interest groups can impact the outcome of national elections and important policy decisions that affect the lives of citizens
• The Cambridge Analytica case study in the OER, illustrates that social media can be used to influence voters without their knowledge (Brexit)

**False stories**
• False stories, particularly sensationalized ones that generate fear or amazement, have always been effective at rapidly spreading and have
sometimes even influenced the course of history.
- A shocking headline or news item is an example of sensationalism
• An organization that purchases information about online users and re-sells it for profit, is known as third-party.
• Clickbait: A headline designed to grab the attention of viewers and entice them to follow the link to its source.

## Class 2 (Oct 8) (Week 12)

#### Understanding Equality and Equity

**Meritocracy**
• Social order which believes that people are ranked or rewarded according to their merit.
• Canada is believed to have been built of meritocracy.
• Is it so?

**Equality**
• Equality denotes sameness - everyone is treated the same without consideration of individual needs, circumstances, background or history.
• But is equality always fair?

• Many factors produce inequality.
• Certain groups and individuals have advantages over others that give them access to opportunity.
• In other words, our society is not a level playing field.
• How do we address social inequality?

**Equity**
• Treating people equally in all cases can preserve inequality because, in most
societies, individuals do not possess equal access to opportunities and resources in the first place.
• In other words, we live in societies where we do not start off as equal and where we do not all have the same chances.
• This is why equity continually asks the question: What is fair?
• Our answers will vary depending on our values.

• Equity: a concept that promotes the treatment of individuals taking into
consideration circumstances, experiences, background, and history.
• Equity is focused on achieving equality of outcomes.
• Examples: transit fares for students, seniors, and adults.
• Why is this? Is this fair?

**How to create a more equitable society?**
Four ways to create equitability:
1. Allow fair and just access to resources regardless of gender, socio-economic status, racial, ethnic, or religious background
2. Examine your own subtle and invisible privileges [i.e. white]
3. Respect every individual's dignity
4. Eliminate hierarchies in society

**Equity and Deficit Thinking**
• One area where a focus on equity is particularly important is education.
• In schools, students who fall behind are often blamed for their failures.
• Their poor performance in school is linked to personal problems or deficiencies, or those of their family, or social, or racial group.
• This is called deficit thinking.

**Deficit Thinking**
• Deficit thinking mainly impacts students from *marginalized* communities.
• It focuses on what students "lack" and aims to "fix" them, while *ignoring* or *minimizing* the structural and systemic issues that affect their lives and learning experiences.
• It looks for simple answers to complex issues like racism, sexism, and classism.
• Deficit thinking *strengthens stereotypes*, *discourages* students, leads to l*ow expectations of students*, and has a negative impact on students' overall education (Baroutsis & Woods, 2018).

**How to Challenge Deficit Thinking?**
• There are different ways deficit thinking can be challenged.
• For example, in the Toronto District School Board, Black students have higher suspension rates than white students.
• To address this, Michelle Bailey proposes using restorative justice instead of suspensions for minor breaches of school rules and codes of conduct (Rankin, Rushowy, & Brown, 2013; James & Turner,2017).

**Equity and Neoliberalism**
• It is important to remember that ideology can affect how we view equity.
• Neoliberalism is a dominant ideology in Western society.
• Some see it as the magic bullet that can resolve all of our problems.

**Neoliberalism**
• Neoliberalism is a theory of *political economic practices* that *proposes that human wellbeing* can best be advanced
by *liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills* within an *institutional framework* characterized by *strong
private property rights, free market, and free trade*.
• The role of the state is to create and preserve an institutional framework appropriate to such practices. (Harvey, 2007, p. 2)

**Critique of Neoliberalism**
• Brochures for *colleges and universities* are filled with images of *racialized minorities*, but these are the people who are most often put at a disadvantage in this system.
• Upon closer inspection, one can see examples of "tokenism."

**Tokenism**
The "practice of including one or a small number of members of a minority group to create the appearance of representation, inclusion, and non-discrimination, *without ever giving* these *members access to power* (Anzovino & Boutilier, 2015).

**Color Blindness**
• Colour blindness : The belief that racial categories should not be considered when examining everyday social relations (Richeson & Nussbaum, 2004).

**Collective historical amnesia & white supremacy**
• Collective historical amnesia:
	• It happens when members of a society conveniently forget their active role in exploitation and oppression of different groups of people.
• White Supremacy:
	• The social ideology used to justify *colonization*. Positions white people as superior to non-white people.
• White Privilege:
	• A system of benefits, advantages, and opportunities experienced by white persons simply because of the colour of their skin.

**Internalized colonization** 
Colonization has acted as the sea of inequity and injustice for centuries and created hierarchies around gender, race, sex, ability, and class that can be difficult to see, let alone resist.
• People who are treated as inferiors for a long time, and as a result develop self-doubt, racist attitudes, and hidden biases towards their own race or themselves are experiencing Internalized colonization

Residential Schools
• The Indian residential school system was a network of mandatory boarding schools for Indigenous peoples.
• The first residential school opened in 1828, and the last one closed in 1996.
• The Canadian government operated Indian residential schools in partnership with the Anglican, Catholic, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches, among others.
• The Canadian government was financially responsible for Indian residential schools.
• It is estimated that over 150,000 Indian, Inuit, and Métis children were taken from their families





# Week 7

## Class 1 (Oct 13 Online)

**Social Stratification**

Capitalism inequalities arise from class division between:
*bourgeoisie* haves (the rich) 
*proletarian* have-nots (the poor).

• Social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of social groups based on their control over basic resources, such as housing, jobs,
healthcare, etc.
• Usually, when we talk about social stratification, we are talking about class,
• but social stratification also includes how class intersects with other statuses such as gender, race, sexuality, and disability.

In all societies today, people have (often vastly) different access to resources, such as
• cars and houses, and other vital things,
• like access to decent healthcare,
• education,
. jobs, etc.
In other words, in every society, different social groups are not all treated equally.
Like layers (another word for layers is strata) that make up an onion, or a tasty cake, societies are structured in levels.
Sociologists and other theorists call this phenomenon social stratification.

**Class**
• The concept of class refers to the relative location of a person or group within a given society based on wealth, power, prestige, or
other valued markers of one's position (status) within a social hierarchy.
• Class determines one's access to rewards, resources, and opportunities, which, in turn, influence one's level of education,
income, occupation, housing, healthcare, and life expectancy.
• Traditionally, class has been divided into five categories:
	• upper class;
	• middle class;
	• working class;
	• working poor; and
	• underclass.

**Privilege**
• Privilege: is gained through unearned power that gives dominant group members economic, social, and political advantage.
• We call them privileges because they are rights, opportunities, or advantages that are not available to everyone equally.
• The privilege is not deserved or attained due to hard work or achievement. Rather, it is assumed merely because one belongs to a
certain group.
• Those who are privileged therefore have opportunities, resources, rights, choices, and freedoms that are categorically denied to others.
• Privilege is often invisible except in cases where we do not have it.
• Privilege is structured and maintained through capital.

**Racial Privilege**
• There is very little representation by visible minorities in the list of the top paid 100 CEOs.
• Many sociologists talk about racial, or white, privilege.
• Often this privilege is seen in employment, housing, and interactions with authorities.
• What do you think happened when José changed his Joe for job applications?

**Economic Capital**
• Economic capital is command over economic resources.
• The more money you have access to, the more you are able to take advantage of rights and opportunities as they are presented to you.

**Cultural Capital**
• Cultural capital is the type of knowledge, education, and skills that can give people a status that can lead to advantages.
• But it is important to note that we are not talking about the kinds of knowledge, education, and skills that are relevant to a particular job.
• Instead, we are referring to having knowledge of or access to a particular culture that allows one to "fit in" with the types of people who can provide opportunities.
• For example, claiming expertise in classical music or being an accomplished golfer is a form of cultural capital. It is a way of establishing your tastes as superior.

**Social Capital**
• Social capital refers to group memberships, networks, and relationships that give certain advantages in work and society.
• Social capital is all about who you know and what they can do for you.
• For example, how often do people get jobs based on having the right connections or knowing people already inside?
• The following video demonstrates how these 3 forms of capital work together to privilege some members of a society.

## Class 2 (Last Class Oct 15)

Social Action Forum:
choose 2 models of social action

#### Social Action for Social Change

**What is social action?**
• Social Action is any action of an individual or group who seeks to promote social change on a small or large scale.
• Social action often involves interactions with other individuals or groups, especially organized action with the goal of social reform.
Social Action occurs when we move from "this isn't fair" to "let's make it fair."
An activist is a person who devotes time and work to bring about positive social change.

**Social Action for Social Justice**
• Social Justice:
	• The full and equal participation of all groups in an egalitarian society, where people's needs are met, and members are physically and psychologically safe 	(Bell, 2007, p. 1).
	• Its aims to address inequities by changing the structural and root cause(s) of social problems.
	• Example: The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement

**Thinking Critically about Social Action**
• Social action is usually understood as an action that promotes a goal of positive change.
• However, as our beliefs, values, and ideologies differ, so do our ideas about what constitutes positive change.
• It is important to note that not all social action works towards social justice.
• Social action can be initiated by anyone with any agenda.
• In fact, much social action arises as a backlash to those fighting for these things.
• It could be political, social, or community groups serving a variety of interests that may be contrary to the principles of social justice.
• Hate groups are some of the most active and effective local and global organizers.
• The point is then to think critically about social action. Who is engaging in social action? To what end? And for what purpose?

**Backlash**
• Backlash refers to "Fear, anger or resistance to a social ideology or actions intended to address social problems"
• Politicians, the media and the police often label social action, which includes both activists and advocacy, as 'special interests'.
• Backlash can range from words and labels used to undermine social action, to organized violence.
• Labels like "special interests," for instance, make social action for change sound like "fringe movements" that only concern a few.
• The racist's reaction to "BIack Lives Matter" with "All lives Matter" is an example of Backlash.

**Social Justice vs Charity**

Charity: immediate help to address the problem for a bit
Social Justice: goes after the root cause of the problem

**Four Models of Social Action**
• Most social action can be broadly grouped into 4 categories.
1. Grassroots Social Action - Bottom-up (get some immigrants or kids of immigrants to start an org)
2. International aid - Top-down
3. Social entrepreneurship - Top-down (funding an org to help immigrants)
4. Online activism/Clicktivism - Bottom-up (for me maybe, countering hate online)

**Grassroots/Bottom-Up Social Action**
• Grassroots:
• A bottom-up approach to social action, where community members at the local level are directly involved and encouraged to contribute to sustainable
positive social change for their community.
• With grassroots activism the agenda is usually driven by the whole community of involved activists.
• An example of a grassroots social action initiative is Idle No More (INM).
• INM was started in 2012 by four women in Saskatchewan to address First Nations treaty issues across Canada.

**Critical thinking of Grassroots**
• *Advantage*:
	• The realistic scale, combined with solutions based on the needs, desires and identity of the
	community, make this kind of social action accessible and beneficial to participants.
	• Grassroots social action can become a social movement .
	
• *Disadvantage*:
1. Grassroots movements must work for change within the system that created the original problem, which can block progress or limit results.
2. They may also collapse due to competing interests or differences within the communities themselves.
3. The constant pressure to compromise, conform, or give up makes grassroots organizing for social change an objective that is difficult to achieve.
4. Grassroots activism also often involves a tremendous investment of time, energy, and resources. Those involved are rarely compensated financially.

**International Aid**
• International aid is an example of top-down social action that crosses national borders.
• It is often called international development or foreign aid.
• International aid involves lending money on a large scale to struggling countries.
• Most international aid is provided with an agenda or conditions.
• Countries that accept the aid are forced to adopt "Western" style industrial economics and join the global market economy.

**Critical Thinking about International Aid**
• Historically, aid has been tied to conditions such as the use of technical advisors, equipment, and supplies that do more to benefit the donor country and
organizations than those receiving the aid.
• Many large-scale aid initiatives (whether by nations or by large charities) have done little to actually improve the lives of those most in nee
• International money has been mismanaged and spent on poorly planned projects.
• Aid benefits the donors, not the recipient countries
• In 2003, $18 billion — more than % of total aid — was spent on technical assistance
• In 2002, aid donors spent $50 to $70 million on 700 international consultants in Cambodia — an equivalent of the salary of 160,000 Cambodian civil servants

**Social Entrepreneurship - "Good"Profit?**
• Social Entrepreneurship: Business for both profit and social good.
• TOMS shoes is an example of social entrepreneurship. For every pair of shoes that you buy, TOMS donates a pair to a child in need.
• The Body Shop appeals to consumers by insisting that it does not test its products on animals.
• Fair Trade products commit to working with farmers and producers to ensure they are paid a fair wage.

**Critical thinking of Social Entrepreneurship**
*Advantage*:
• Social entrepreneurship can work within the current economic system in a way that benefits workers, communities and the environment.
• This makes it practical and sustainable.
• Because it does not threaten existing power structures, it is less likely to face resistance (compared to, for example, grassroots movements).
*Disadvantage*:
• Critics claim that profit is still the priority. Ethical business practices are used as a marketing tool.
• Therefore, social entrepreneurship does not signal a shift in ideology.
It does not create structural change but functions within the larger system of exploitation, so it is not a lasting solution.


**Online Activism/Clicktivism**
• Online activism is an increasingly powerful tool for raising awareness of issues and organizing people around the world to work towards social change.
• Online activism - and social networking - offers many advantages. It can reach millions of people instantly and bring together individuals and organizations
separated by time and distance.
• Clicktivism: Online "awareness campaigns" that use the internet to rally support for causes with methods like petitions, "favoriting," or re-posting content
about social justice issues.
• Many grassroots organizations use the internet to organize and bring attention to their cause.

**Online Activism/CIicktivism/SIacktivism**
• For most online campaigns, the commitment expected is minimal. Because of this, online activism has been critiqued as "slacktivism, "
not activism.
• Critics also point out that clicktivism is often used as virtue signalling on social media.
• Virtue Signaling:
	• The action or practice of publicly expressing opinions or sentiments intended to demonstrate one's good character or the moral correctness of one's position on a particular issue.
• Slacktivism:
	• But online activism can also become slacktivism.
	• Critics point out that it can become the easy option requiring little commitment and participation.
	• It can make people feel good rather than actually changing the status quo.

Activism, Allyship, and Advocacy
• Activist:
• An individual who devotes time to work, either paid or unpaid, to bring about social change.
• Ally:
• An individual who may not belong to a marginalized group but supports their struggle
• Advocate:
• An individual whose privileged position allows them to speak on behalf of
others experiencing inequality, often through legal or institutional activities for equality.
