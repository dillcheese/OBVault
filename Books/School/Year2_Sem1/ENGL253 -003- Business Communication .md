Title Page and Reference List

*Memo*
Context,
Why you're sending the message 


## Week 5 (October 3)

Week 7 before reading week: Midterm (all skills in class)
**Business email for bad news**

*Indirect Approach*
By opening with the explanation before stating the decision, the writer can gain an advantage of greater tact and diplomacy.
Used for when: you don’t know the reader well, the bad news isn’t anticipated by the reader, you anticipate a strong negative reaction from the reader


The *buffer* (one to three sentences) is a first defence against toxic messaging that puts the reader in a more agreeable frame of mind, helping to neutralize the bad news when it is finally revealed (particularly useful in messages intended for superiors, customers, or job applicants).

Opening—Begin with a one-to-three-sentence buffer to cushion the bad news, and guide the reader to the explanation.
Middle—Explanation—Provide a solid, reasonable explanation that will help the reader understand and accept the bad news. 
Middle—State the bad news —Phrase the bad news to minimize its impact and, if possible, balance it with an alternative.
Closing —Close pleasantly with a goodwill statement, showing consideration for the reader

## Week 6 (October 10)

Midterm Next Week
2 out of 20 potential scenarios (write an email for)

Will need to decide whether or not to use the DIRECT or INDIRECT approach and to compose an appropriate email that corresponds to the needs of the scenario.

#### DIRECT:
For more close relationships
Short, concise and lots of whitespace
Short paragraphs or bulleted list (max skimmablilty)

Opening
Middle 
End

#### INDIRECT: 
For bad news or persuasion
Meant for more distant recipients (customer-company, boss-worker)

*Opening:* Begins with a buffer that cushions bad news, guides reader to the news.

*Middle-Explanation:* Provide explanation that helps reader understand and accept bad news
positive, negative (should be spoken in a positive light)

*Middle-bad news:* Phrase bad news to minimize its impact and, if possible, balance with an alternative

*Closing:* Close pleasantly with a goodwill statement  (bad news, don't put 'thank you for your understanding' or contact info unless you want them to contact you)

### Persuasive Appeals

page 315 of the pdf

**Appeal to reason/logic (logos):** 

Appeal to emotion (pathos/pathetic appeal):

Appeal to ethics/credibility (ethos): 

Usually use a combination of at least 2 appeals

Beginning: emotional appeal
Middle: logical appeal
	credibility appeal: optional 

### Types of Persuasive Messages

Avoid apologies in business emails unless it is an apology letter (apologize only once)
Chose appeal according to your audience (VP of company: interested in numbers/bottom line, not emotional)


**Favour and Action Requests**

Complimentary start to message.


**Persuasive Memo**

	Persuasion for Managing Change and Motivating Performance 

Focus on the solution instead of the challenge (I want to present a solution to a recurring problem within the company)

**Claim Request**

**Collection Letter**

## Week 7 (October 17)

### Review:

##### DIRECT

Direct-approach message: A message that presents the main point in the first paragraph.

*Opening* - delivers main message first. states the good news; makes a direct, specific request; or provides the most important information.
*Middle* - explains details of the news or inquiry and supplies background and clarification when needed. If there are further points or questions, they are presented in parallel form in a bulleted or numbered list
*Closing* - ends pleasantly in one or more of the following ways: provides contact information; asks for action, input, or a response, often by a deadline; tells the reader what happens next; communicates goodwill; or shows appreciation.

**When to Use**:
- Audience is **neutral or positive** about the message
- You want to save time and be efficient
- Common in **business reports, routine emails, proposals**

Types: 
Requests 
	Info or Action Requests
	Order Requests
	Claim Letters () 	

Response
	Info Response

Goodwill Messages
Informative Letters
	Announcements
