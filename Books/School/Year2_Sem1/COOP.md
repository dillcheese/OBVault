**Coding Assessments** 
Code Signal 
Leetcode

Code assessment is make or break in post grad jobs
Speed and accuracy
[Just took my first CodeSignal Assessment : cscareerquestions](https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/xhw4ly/just_took_my_first_codesignal_assessment/)

like others said, format is Q1: LC Easy Warmup Q2: LC Easy+ - Medium warmup Q3: longest question that is designed to get out of hand very quickly Q4: algorithm
My advice is to do Q1 and Q2 first and do it quick. Nobody is going to read the code on this, so the quickest dirty solutions that get you the 100/100 is all you need.
Skip 3 and go straight to 4. This is the type of question that you can get a 70/100 on pretty quick, but those last optimizations and smart DS choices will get you the runtime for the edge cases. Write a solution that works and don't worry for now if it's not optimal. Should take you maybe 5-10 minutes MAX. Do NOT spend more than that here.
NOW go back to question 3. Spend most of your time here, there's no shortcuts. You have to apply good software principals and be mindful with how you break up your functions. Spend your time writing a good foundation for the solution. If you write a big mega-function you will be in pain debugging your solution. Get this to 100/100.
Now if you have time leftover (aim to give yourself 10 minutes at least if you can), go back to question 4. What helped was doing the question the first time around and letting the question sit in the back of your head for a while. You come back to it with a fresh mind and will have an easier time finding flaws and optimizations in your first attempt.


Job check stuff
NDA
Record check/ background check (charged with a criminal act)
Vulnerable sector check (for when you are accessing info about vulnerable people[children, elders etc.] more intense background check)
/security clearance (most intense, usually done by govt jobs like nuclear plant) 
Bondable (not bondable if u commit fraud)

*Type of Interviews*
In-person (15 mins before, take copies of what they asked for in the application process, copy of reference list)
Virtual
Phone
Task Oriented (whiteboard, solve problem in front of the interviewer, coding tests etc.)

*No experience with tech/tool*
1. Describe (AWS is a cloud tool)
2. Related (talk about related tools like Google cloud to AWS)
3. Learn (I'm excited to learn how to use these tools)

Tell them what you do in real life to solve a problem if you don't know how.

**Ask the Interviewer Questions**

What are the next steps for the hiring process?
Can you give an example of a project a former coop student worked on?
How do you measure success of a coop student?
How is it like working there (question might give cookie cutter answer/ not much info)
Ask something about job posting (what sort of collaboration tools)

Don't ask
- pay
- modality (hybrid, how many days?)
- feedback (how i did during the interview)

Research the company to get an idea of what it does
48-72 business hrs before interview (follow up for join link)
Do not do interviews on Campus with MS Teams (deadzones?)

*Discussion Points:*
Career direction: don't be generic (want to be SWE) be more specific (interest in AI and innovation)
Avoid looking desperate: clear about goals (don't say looking for anything)

*References:* professional people who can say nice things about you

## Class 2 (November 3)

**LinkedIn**
Courses: List out courses for education and use keywords; Advanced databases (SQL)

**Behavioural Interview Questions**

From the past tell me a time you had to work with a difficult colleague. 
*Not a behaviour question:* What would you do if you have a difficult colleague

**STAR**
Situation
Task
Action (you should be the one taking/leading the action)
Result

**Tricky Questions**
*What are your salary expectations?*
Compare company to similar companies (Loblaws to Canadian Tire) then give a range (75k-85k or $19/hr - $24/hr [for coop])
try to avoid straight answer (if one number go for median in range)

*Negotiation*
If you have over the job qualification you can negotiate
Ask a question, don't demand (I have 2 YoE in Java compared to 6 months can I get more?)

*What is your weakness? / professional development*
Don't say a soft skill. 

**Three E**
Experience
Education
Employer

[www.canadastop100.com](https://www.canadastop100.com/)
(paid internships = new grad jobs 18 months)

Hidden Job Market: 70% of jobs
Connections/Network based

**Networking**
10,000 Coffees (profile that matches you with a matching profile, usually from employers)
meetup.com (search for keywords like software developer)

**Job search resources**
Experience centennial (job search resources links: career tab)

Google Jobs
Eluta

**Red Flags for Scam**
Weekly pay (usually hourly or salary)
Small Companies with Low Online Presence

**Wimtach**
Summer jobs


## Last Class (Nov 10)

Once you accept a job, stop searching decline future interviews and no longer have access to Experience Centennial.

**Work Terms**
12-16 weeks
Min: 300 hours 

To get coop 3 you need coop 2 work term (if you can't you go back to regular stream)

Can fail coop if you get fired.
- if you quit (if unsafe or mistreated talk to coop first)
- fail to report to work for a position (not going to work)
- terminated by employer for just cause (behaviour things [sexism, racism], being bad at code doesn't count)
- do not submit work term assignments

**Midpoint:** check in on student and employer
Complaints
1. Cell phone use (if in office, don't do that)
2. Remote work (lack of communication from home, if you take 45 mins during work hours bad look, be responsive) (student was terminated from remote work for working Uber Eats during job, fired for time theft)
3. Vacation (no vacation days, might get 1 unpaid day, statutory holidays count as day off)
4. Sick days (no paid sick days, call in sick, unpaid)
5. Overtime (no obligation, can say yes or no, 1.5x wage)

Coop worth 10 credits (fail affects GPA)
(60%) *Employer performance evaluation* (how well you did on the job)
evaluates (interest in work ,initiative, quality of work, learning ability, dependability, judgement, attendance, oral comm.)
discuss with you (supervisor or Nita if supervisor says no) 
e.g: Can do well on coop even if your bad at programming (if you're a hard worker you can do well on coop). Communicate if you have an issue. 

(40%) 1 reflection assignment/ work term assignment (submit through luminate)

**Coop Advisor Visit (Mid-Term)**
Coop advisor might discuss:
overall experience
new skills acquired

Visit to Employer
- get feedback on student's performance
- discuss evaluation form completion and submission
- answer questions about coop

*Suggestions*
Meet with supervisor midway work term for feedback for me (when Nita is about to visit).

Try not to be offended at feedback
Be prepared to provide evidence of your achievements and identify where you need more support
Maintain relations hip and have emotional maturity
Have good attitude ()
Employers don't really have an issue with technical skills (java etc.)
Right to disconnect (employers can't contact you outside of work hours, no need to respond at night)


**Coop expectations of employer** 
- Safe work environment
- WSIB coverage (insurance) for student
- Provide appropriate training and support (supervisor should have someone to provide training and support for your task, e.g: backend dev should have a dev there to support you)

**Expectations of students**
- further develop technical and soft skills
- professional conduct at all times (ambassador for Centennial, don't be racist etc.)

**Workplace Etiquette**
Treated as equals and with respect
allowed to ask for special considerations (e.g, disability, religious)
Use names (not mr., ms.) (use name they introduce themselves with) (if you forget just ask agiain [meeting new people what is your name again?])
Protected grounds (can't be discriminated against)

**Workplace Conflict** 
Conflict might arise (might be multiple coop students in a team) (miscommunication, personality clash, poor performance)

Can email Nita
Try to fix it first before getting other people involved

**Meetings**
- Roles
	-  Meeting chair, facilitator, note taker (often coop students), Important: follow-up, action items
	- if note take ask for past meeting minutes to have same format
	- Coop students don't talk, try talking more in meetings 

Send professional emails (use AI to help if you need)

**Communications with Supervisors**
- Requests to supervisors (get request in writing) (training, accommodations, interviews) (day off, write a email saying thanks for allowing me to take a day off)
- Declining requests from supervisor (no overtime, different shift etc.)

**Using AI**
Use AI as a helper, apply some critical thinking
