# Week 1 Class 1 (Sept 2)

SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
	
Group Assignments
Part A: Create SRS
Part B: 
Part C: 

*Functional Requirements:* Statements that define what a system must do, detailing its specific features, operations, and functions, including how it should react to specific inputs and produce outputs.

*Non-functional Requirements:* Specifies how a system should operate, focusing on quality attributes and constraints rather than specific functions (speed, security etc.)

*Requirements Analysis:* Operational characteristics


# Week 1 Class 2 (Sept 3)

Agile

Scrum Manager: 

UML: Language for developers, analysts, designers and stakeholders.


<u>UML Use Case Diagrams:</u> Identify the Use Cases in a system

<u>Systems Sequence Diagram:</u> ( Note to be confused with a Sequence diagram which is design artefact).

# Week 2 Class 1 (Sept 9)

new section
Every week a new quiz

Core 12 Agile Manifesto values:

1. To **satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software** is the highest priority.
2. **Changes of requirements are always welcomed**, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Maintain a **frequent rate of delivering working software**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. **Business stakeholders and developers must work together daily** throughout the project.
5. Conduct projects around motivated individuals. Give them the **environment, resources, and other support** they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective way of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation**.
7. **Working software** is the primary measure of the progress of the project.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to **maintain a constant pace** indefinitely.
9. Continuous **attention to technical excellence and good design** enhances agility.
10. **Simplicity** - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams**.
12. At regular intervals, the team **reflects on how to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

# Week 3 Class 1 (Sept 16)


Software Dev Chain
Analysis? -> System Description -> Design -> Implementation -> Production


**10 Software Design Principles**

1. Design should be traceable to the requirements model
2. Always consider the architecture of the system to be built
3. Design of data is as important as design of processing functions
4. d
5. User interface design should be tuned to the needs of the end-user and the stress ease of use
6. Component-level design should be functionally independent
7. 

Data model is more important than the class model
The **data model** defines how information is structured, stored, and related — which is critical for persistence, integration, and ensuring business rules are enforced.
The **class model** focuses on object-oriented design, encapsulation, and behavior within the application.

# Week 3 Class 2 (Sept 18)

Domain class Diagram



# Week 4 Class 1 (Sept 23)


Aggregation



# Week 4 Class 2 (Sept 25)
**Group Draft review**

Group 1
Use cases need to be more detailed? 

Group 2 
Need non functional requirements 

Group 3 (Us)
Come up with more specific name


*Domain class diagram* 


Classes have attributes and methods


Logical Layer

# Week 5 Class (Oct 2)

# Week 6 Class 1 (Oct 7)


**Component Level Design**

Handler

A _domain model_ is called _conceptual model_ in database modeling, while a _design model_ is called _logical model_.

These distinctions are also used in model-driven development, where we have a succession of three types of models:

1. (solution-independent) **_domain models_** resulting from domain/requirements engineering in the system analysis, or inception, phase of a development project;
2. (platform-independent) **_design models_** resulting from the system design activities in the elaboration phase and typically based on a _domain model_;
3. (platform-specific) **_implementation models_**, which may be (e.g., JavaScript or Java EE) **_class models_**, SQL **_table models_** or other types of **_data models_** derived from an information design model.

While system modeling includes both information and process modeling, you seem to be concerned with information modeling only. Here, we can use the terms "domain class diagram" and "design class diagram" for the conceptual information model and the information design model made in the form of UML class diagrams.

# Week 7 Class 1 (Oct 14)

Go over the 4 quizzes
Midterm (After reading week)


Organization = collection of software systems
Half theory, half practical (know what you've done on your project, class diagram etc.)
